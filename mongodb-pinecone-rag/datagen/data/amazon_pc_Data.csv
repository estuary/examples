This is my own opinion of the device.<br /><br />Overall OnHub is a pretty no nonsense type router that just works. Its super simple to setup with your phone, is fast and auto updates. I have not looked back ever since I set it up. The beauty in this router is that it gets better over time. You know what I mean if you have a ChromeBook. It auto updates and you never have to deal with firmware and security updates or adjusting settings on the device to get the optimal performance for your WiFi network. It just figures it out on its own.<br /><br />Why I love it:<br />1) Auto Updates. Probably the one of the main selling points. I have witnessed this first hand. It uses the power of the cloud to update. No security updates to apply, no firmware patches to apply, no need to plug in your laptop to set it up or flash, etc. It does it automatically through the internet.<br /><br />2) It's fast. I probably have 6-7 devices connected through WiFi and they all perform pretty well. I didn’t notice any performance differences when streaming Netflix or YouTube using the Ethernet connection or Wireless network.<br /><br />3) The Android app makes it dead simple to share your WiFi password, perform speed tests on your internet connection, see how much bandwidth devices on your network are using, and updated your typical settings you see in a WiFi router. The added bonus is you can even do it from anywhere you have a internet connection. No need to be on your home network. The default settings worked straight out of the box beautifully. (There is an iOS app, which has similar features)<br /><br />4) There are 2.4GHz and 5GHz antennas which should cover all your devices. The interesting bit for me, was that you only need one SSID for both frequencies. There is no concept of network-name and network-name-5g if you have a used a router in the past that broadcasted both frequencies. It will automatically figure out which is the better frequency for you and use that.<br /><br />5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings. You control everything through your phone, including adding additional managers to administer the device. Although, I haven’t actually had the need to use this, it might come in handy to help a friend or family member if they had some questions.<br /><br />6) It looks nice enough that I don’t need to hide it in my TV stand and can leave it out in the open.<br /><br />Why you may not like it:<br />1) The OnHub only has 1 Ethernet port, where as my old router had 4. While I thought I would miss this early on, I actually found that connecting all my devices via WiFi just seemed so much simpler and cleaner. If you need more ports for wired internet access, you will need a switch.<br /><br />2) There is no web interface to administrate the device, but I didn’t really miss it. Well, okay I will admit I did at first, since I was so use to it from my old access point. After the initial setup though, you don’t really need to touch any settings. As I mentioned before, you control everything through your phone, if you need to change anything or check the status.<br /><br />Future Wish List:<br />There is a pretty nice looking speaker on top that I heard during setup. It would be cool if this could be used in some other ways, other than just for setup. Maybe a future update?use that. 5) No administrator password to remember or gateway ip to remember to update settings.

The range and speed was acceptable, although, for the price I would have liked better. This would probably have been a 3 or 4 star review except, as of mid July, 2015, it has stopped working properly. One day, out of the blue, it no longer provided an internet connection. The wireless network still exists but all devices attached show no internet connection. The same happens for any devices connected via Ethernet through the router. I have tried all the following in troubleshooting:<br />1: connected straight to the modem and had an internet connection.<br />2: Reset to factory settings and connected to default network but no internet.<br />3: Connected replacement router via same ethernet cable to the modem and it provided internet without issue.<br />4: checked router, power adapter, and Ethernet cable for any signs of damage (we have a cat) but none exist.<br /><br />So, As a result, I am rather upset that this product did not even last 2 years. I paid $135 for this thing new. It I had wanted a disposable product i would have spent 30 bucks on a cheap wireless N router and called it a day.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a fix or something for this issue, I will try it and gladly take this up to 3 or so stars but for the time being, I really believe it deserves one star.",2015-08-31

Enter the Seagate 2TB drive. Now I can have that feeling again of, &#34;There, now I'll never have to worry about storage again.&#34;<br /><br />This Seagate game drive seems to be a pretty typical 2TB hard drive, priced similar to other 2TB drives, but with officially licensed Xbox One or Xbox 360 compatibility and design. When you consider the basic Xbox One 500GB console is currently priced around $350 and the newer 1 TB model is about $400, you could get the 500GB model and one of these drives (currently $100) and spend about $450 and have a total of 2.5 TB of storage. Basically, an extra 1.5 TB for an extra $50, which isn't a bad deal. Of course, you have to consider your current usage and potential future storage needs.<br /><br />The main thing I think it lacks is a little more in the way of instructions for transferring data from the console to the drive. While it wasn't that difficult for me to figure out, it might be a little more challenging for a parent who is not as up to speed on how these work. Especially considering it is an officially licensed Xbox product, it was surprising there was little more than a short pamphlet describing the drive's features included. I wish it would have gone into more detail about how it handles in-game DLC licensing content vs game content. It was not the most user friendly in that regard. I finished transferring data and wasn't positive if I was going to be able to play with DLC once it was moved to the drive (I was). A little more clarity in what it would and would not transfer would have been helpful as well as explanation on what you need to do if you use it on an Xbox 360, then upgrade to the Xbox One. I plan to do this in a few weeks, so I mayupdate the review if I hit any other snags in that process.",2015-08-31

Notice the bag is marked Right Angle, but it is clearly the Left Angle version. I need the other one.<br /><br />Not sure what I'll get if I order Right Angle again... Maybe someone at Amazon or StarTech can grab another one, look at the cable in the bag, verify it's the correct one and send it.",2015-08-31

I'm pretty sure it worked fine, although I don't like the way they position the Enter key. Apparently I'm used to Dell keyboards because I've used them for decades and now i'm used to the Enter key being horizontally long and the \ key being above it. But it seems like most keyboards that I see these days have them switched, so when I use them I keep hitting / instead of Enter and it's infuriating.<br /><br />Sooner or later I'll have to adjust since it appears to be the standard for newer keyboards. Gotta start reaching farther out for that Enter key!",2015-08-31
