They were together then not together, together and then not, over and over again. Like a tennis match, it was entertaining at times, but was nerve racking and tiring to watch. Yet, I couldn't stop reading. Although it was painful to witness, I did like the dilemma Callum found himself in when the woman who had shattered his heart suddenly came back to him and wanted him back. He was caught between that proverbial rock and a hard place and was forced to make an impossibly tough choice. But, just like in a tennis match, in order for Callum to win in Love, he had to put himself out there, face his opponent head on with everything he had, and fight to win.

I laughed out loud numerous times at his tactics in getting Joy's attention. Joy was strong-willed, funny, determined, and didn't take anything off anybody. Joy and Quince had to work out their issues while dealing with some of Lex' s followers that wanted to cause trouble. By the Tail was funny, heartwarming, hot and steamy with added action.

It drew me in from the first chapter and I couldn't put it down until I turned the last page, other than to send teasers to my Facebook page. I loved the characters. Their story was an emotional roller coaster ride for me. Everyone sees Nora as the perfect, innocent, rich girl, but she has scars and things she hides from the world. When Leo meets Nora they have an instant connection. Their story makes the reader believe in soul mates and destiny. A beautiful love story with hot and steamy romance. Loved it and can not wait to find out who will star in the next Briarcrest Academy book.<br /><br />*Review copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Twitter: @readingpajamas",2013-09-09

At least until the chapter when the body is discovered. Then the author seemed to loose focus. Sam's character suddenly reveled she has mob connections and we are introduced to a group of people called the Mom Squad. They somehow play a role in solving the mystery You are also introduced to Nick's crazy aunt which sets up the second book.<br /><br />In the second book the crazy aunt has a voodoo curse go wrong and everybody including the Sherriff is running around trying to undo the curse with more magic. Which by the way the author insists on misspelling. Some part of the story are humorous but it would have benefited from a good editor. Sam's character expresses interest in learning magic (my spelling not theirs) in this book.<br /><br />Now we hit the third book in which we again find Sam's Mom squad and now we find out that Sam is related to Santa Claus and the Grams character is dating father time. We also see the return of Magic in the form of the queen of the witches. So if Sam wanted to learn more about magic why didn't she just go to this witch she already knows?<br /><br />The authors seem to be addicted the unbelievable plot twist school of writing. They also like to change voices pretty much every chapter from Nick to Sam unless they don't. Kind of like the book I couldn't really find a pattern. They started out with a good premise and then seemed to say &#34;Oh well lets write this half stoned&#34;.<br /><br />Truthfully I would have given it two stars but, knowing what is involved in writing a book and given the fact it did hold my attention if only to find out what whacked out thing they would introduce next I gave it three.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good mystery this isn't it.

Lewis’ ethical dilemma about his counter-transference experience was also very interesting and how he dealt with his struggle and guilt. But I also felt it was more than average counter-transference expereince as Lewis had a powerful crush on Lewis from his high school days. I really liked the way Josephine tactfully created Lewis’ profession so noone would be too caught up that a therapist was emotionally & sexually involved with a patient….well… Lewis was still Jasper’s therapist albeit an unregistered one but at least they took 6 month away from each other and then Lewis decided to study further (which would help him to understand more about the dynamics in a therapeutic relationship)…so I felt better as a professional…<br />I also liked the way Josephine added a little sexual intimacy without overwhelming Jasper and Lewis’ emotional journey…<br /><br />Lewis’s parents were simple adorable!!! They reminded of the previous owner of my home so I kept laughing whenever I visualised them walking around naked doing chores…bending around to pick up things…putting the baking tray into the oven…sitting around…hahahhaaaaa<br /><br />There were no perfect bodies with stunning features in this book , how refreshing is that! Jasper and Lewis were just everyday individuals dealing with life and desperately trying to resolve their personal issues.<br /><br />I think, Josephine wrote this story with a wonderful level of sensitiveness and empathy.

It's not easy to fit so much story, background, personality, passion and love in so few pages. Not only does Ms. Summers accomplish this, but she does so in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />Erin McDonald is getting through each day by putting on a happy face and acting as if she is suffering from a broken heart. For the love of god, 8 years has gone by. Is it going to stop hurting when she thinks of Jesse and how he left her behind? Probably not, especially now that he's back in town for a visit. Her body and heart seems to have forgotten that he's bad news and leads to nothing, but pain.<br /><br />Jesse Hackett has never regretted his decision to leave behind the country life for a successful career in the city. But, he's always been haunted by the loss of the love of his life. He's back in town for his mom's birthday and he wants nothing more than to rekindle the old flame. How to do that without breaking both of their hearts even more is the big question. He is only visiting and will be going back to his life in the city and he knows Erin would never follow him.<br /><br />This book is not short on heat and passion, that's for sure. The witty banter between Erin and her sister made me laugh out loud in more than one spot. Eden really is very good at sarcastic humor, which just happens to be my first language. The love between Jesse and Erin was bittersweet, yet fun to read. I highly recommend this book and any other Eden Summers story.

Shirley Jones was an actress that I admired from afar, until I read about her choices in life. To begin, the book isn't well-written. Jones frequently repeats herself, her sentence structure lacks clarity, and her use of personal pronouns is at times confusing. I could, however, forgive these distractions; after all, she's an actress and singer, not a writer. But she should have made use of a good editor or ghost writer. That said, what I found most unappealing were her vivid descriptions of her sexual mores and lascivious forays with Jack Cassidy, including a 3-way event. Not only does she make clear that Mister Cassidy was \\""very well-endowed,\\"" but she also tells us that his son was even bigger. Cassidy, as everyone knew, was an unrelenting cheat and adulterer. But this didn't seem to bother Jones much. At least, not enough to stop loving him or to leave him for many years. The Jones-Cassidy family were dysfunction because, it seems, that neither Jones nor Cassidy did what caring parents are supposed to do. Near the end of the book, Jones repeatedly attempts to justify her marriage to Marty Ingels-as she has been doing for more than 30 years. Jones claims she loved Cassidy (and still does), and that she loves Ingels. Both men, as she describes them, have serious flaws that she excuses and forgives out of hand. Unfortunately, she isn't a very sophisticated women, coming from a small town in Pennsylvania. I know that \\""Tell All\\"" autobiographies sell books, but I think Jones discredits herself in this missive. An example of this is, at the end of the book, she proudly boasts (in some detail) of still masturbating regularly at 80 years of age. As Miss Jones warns the reader early in her book, she is not the quaint, innocent young lady she flawlessly portrayed in her early films. And that's just too bad!",2013-09-09

So, once I finally had it at my wee little fingertips, I DEVOURED it. I could not stop reading, I needed to satiate my hunger for all things Nora Blakely....and Leo Tate too!<br /><br />Nora, Nora, Nora!!! Girl you've gone and rocked my world. I've never hoped for a character to come out on top, as I did Nora. She's the epitome of perfection, beauty, and brains. She has the world at her fingertips and little does she know it, men within arms reach. She may have been fed by the silver spoon, but it wasn't always skittles rainbows and fluffy unicorns. Nope! Life has been anything but wonderful for Nora. Basically she was thrown to the wolves....and by wolves I mean her wonderful family. They are wolves in sheep's clothing. Other than the wolves, I was completely intrigued with Nora's approach on life. She is ready to let go of the good girl persona, and step into the world of carelessness, fun, partying, and God knows what else. She may walk on the wild side, but sometimes life throws you a gazillion curve balls when you least expect it to....enter Leo Tate, Baby!<br /><br />Dear goodness, Leo had me wrapped around his pinky finger the moment he waltzed into my life. Not only does he have stunningly good looks, he has bad boy written all over him. So yeh he's super sexy!! And he also shines bright like a diamond, in my eyes. He is a bad boy in every which way, but holy hell he is also one of the kindest men on the planet. Oh did I mention he is also a freaking delicious Rocker Man?!?!?!?! Yeh, he is. He literally will boogie woogie his way into your heart. As much as he is kind and beautiful, he is totally off limits to any woman under the age 25....but little does he know, his world is gonna tilt on its axis when Nora Blakely, not so graciously, enters his life.<br /><br />I need more Sebastian's and Mila's in my life. These two are the very bestest friends ever ever ever!!! I loved them to pieces. They are the type of friends that would bend over backwards to fulfill any request to make Nora happy. They love her completely. They're her rock when she needs them, and they help keep her sane and somewhat smart when decision making. Seriously, Mila and Seb complete me. They helped Nora spread her wings, so she could to learn to fly!<br /><br />Wanna talk angst? Well ok. I didn't know what to expect in the angst dept., but damn it was off the charts. I kept waiting for it to stop. But it didn't, not once. The angst first begins the second Nora and Leo meet, and then it snowballs from there. Their sexual chemistry is angsty too.....hot damn!!! I could talk for days about the desires and want that was flaming, but it would get boring....so you just need to know it had me at hello! I loved every second of their angst/chemistry factor!<br /><br />Sooooo...I went into this book thinking things were going to be hunky-dory and all will be right in the world. Well I was in for a surprise. All my first thoughts about this book, flew out the window. They were then replaced with WTH?!?! moments, and swoony ones too! For this being a debut book by Author Ilsa Madden-Mills, she hit the ball out of the park! She wrote a story full of hope, dreams, love, heartache, and chances. If you're looking for a book to eat up, then this is the one for you. I could not put this book down. I am head over heels in love with it. And I am so eager to continue reading this series.

Can't wait to read the series!","I had a hard time figuring out how to write this review. I loved this book, but if you're looking to this book because it's a BDSM series, you'll be a little disappointed. Maybe. Well, I hope not. But let me explain. The author starts out the book telling you exactly what you're going to get. Backstory.<br /><br />You get the backstory for the main characters in a multi-book BDSM series (the Rescue Me series). There's not much sex in this book at all. A couple of steamy scenes that are tame from a BDSM point of view and one scene that is graphic that shows one of the characters forced into sexual slavery (so it's not at all sexy).<br /><br />That said, this book is fantastically written. The characters are amazing. I loved them all. The depth they show, the real, authentic feelings, and their actions all drew me in. I will be reading every book in this series because I am so invested in these characters now.<br /><br />So buy this book. Read it. Get to know Adam, Damien, and Marc. (Also Kayla and Savi.) And then buy the rest of the books in the series.",2013-09-09

Mason is looking to refurbish this estate and move on. He needs an assistant for only 12 weeks so the job can be finished in time.<br /><br />Billie is looking for a temporary arrangement where she can make money to go to college. This job opportunity sounds almost perfect... until you factor in the chemistry they both feel.<br /><br />This story was heartwarming, sensual, and extremely sensitive to the topic of losing a child. Mason is the broken man - broken by the loss of his daughter and the dissolution of his first marriage. All he is interested in is working, keeping his mind busy so he does not have to think about his feelings, and being able to sleep at night. Although he keeps busy, his thoughts still plague him and sleep eludes him.<br /><br />Billie's influence on Mason is obvious from the very beginning of their strange arrangement. She is so full of love and empathy, she could rally anyone to happiness. I love how she handles Mason and brings him around kicking an screaming, so to speak, so he can face life, his feelings and finally become a worthy member of society.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic one day read full of entertainment. Tastefully sensual, this romantic story will leave you smiling.",2013-09-09

If Saturday and Sunday weren't so busy I would have finished it Saturday at least by lunch! But by 3pm Sunday I was finished.<br /><br />I love Skye, she's vulnerable and she may not know what she wants, but she does know what she doesn't want. She's a grownup who has never been on their own, not really.<br />I like the detailed best friendship she has with Paige as well as her relationship with her younger brother.<br />I also like the depth of Asher's character.<br />I absolutely loved the plot and the journey. Skye is a girl we all have inside. She's taking the 'what if's' out of the equation. Figuring out who she is and what she really wants.
