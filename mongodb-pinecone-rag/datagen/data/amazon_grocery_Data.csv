There is no added sugar which is a selling point for me as my fiance has diabetes and I try to watch my sugar intake as well. There is a mild amount of caffeine in the drink which I prefer as too much caffeine makes me jittery. V8 V-Fusion +Energy has just enough to get you through a busy morning.

I know it's probably cheaper for the company, but I'd prefer to pay more and have a formulation closer to breast milk.
