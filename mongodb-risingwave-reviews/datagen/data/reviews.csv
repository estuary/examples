His cousin lives upstairs, and she was very nice and helpful, too. The internet only worked about half the time, and everything on the street can be heard from the main bedroom. Wonderful stay- it was exactly what we needed. It is not in the best area of town, but I never felt unsafe. "
2992450,21810844,2014-10-24,22648856,Christopher,"This may be a little late, but just to say Kenneth was quick to respond to our request. He left some supplies in the refrigerator and kindly showed us round downtown Albany. We were without a car and he arranged for his cousin Kristina to take us to  supermarket.
<br/>The apartment is large, clean with many original features. It is situated in an historical area that is fairly central, although like the rest of Albany you have to climb a steep hill to get to it if you are on foot. 
<br/>"
2992450,27434334,2015-03-04,45406,Altay,"The apartment was very clean and convenient to downtown. One thing to keep in mind: one bedroom is huge and the other is tiny, so if you're traveling with a friend you might have to flip a coin. :)"
2992450,28524578,2015-03-25,5485362,John,"Kenneth was ready when I got there and arranged for the upstairs neighbor to meet me at the door with the keys.  Shortly after that I was left on my own in the privacy of this large 2 BR apartment - just like I like it.   I really like my privacy and there was no time at which anyone came to visit me or bother me unannounced.  At one point Kenneth had to pic up a refrigerator stored in the apartment, but the neighbor lady gave me plenty of notice and I was on my way out before he got there.  When I returned the extra refrigerator was gone and I had the nice quiet apartment to myself.  At one point I went to take a shower and found some body wash in a drawer.  That was nice since all I brought with me was shampoo.    The apartment is a city street apartment meaning that like many two family homes the BR window is feet away from the public sidewalk and you can hear people all hours of the night walking by and conversing, but its not terribly disruptive.  Overall the apartment was just what I needed and I had an enjoyable time while there.  The heat worked perfectly and the apartment was picked up.  The bed was a king size and very comfortable with sensible pillows and coverings.  The water pressure on the shower was awesome."
2992450,35913434,2015-06-23,15772025,Jennifer,"We were pleased to see how 2nd Street and the Ten Broeck neighborhood in Albany have come along. Its great to see all of the gorgeous brownstones, including the one we stayed in, being renovated and cared for.<br/>In terms of quality, I was pleased by the courtesy of the host's friend who lived nearby. He was there to let us in and make sure I knew to call with any problems. With a full kitchen and two bedrooms, my daughter and I felt at home with plenty of space. As a native of Albany I'm used to thin windows and occasionally noisy neighbors. If you don't sleep well, don't take the master bedroom and be aware that loud music may be playing during the evening and weekend. But there is a fan/ac unit to drown out the din from the street.<br/>This space has been renovated and a vast improvement I'm sure from where it was, and I'm hoping progress will continue here as it seemed a few projects were incomplete. I would have loved to enjoy more sunlight in the house but there was a ton of tree debris in the back yard so there was no way to enjoy opening the windows.<br/>On my own, this place was fine, but if traveling with my child again I will probably pick a quieter location where I'd be able to open windows or put her down for a nap without worrying about excessive noise."
2992450,38893053,2015-07-19,11614467,Stephanie,"The flat is not in a good area, while we were fine you do have to be careful (even our cab driver told us that) I wouldn't stay again. The flat also does not have air con- the large bedroom had an obnoxiously loud fan which kept the one room cool, the rest of the house is very hot. So if you are going to stay here bear these things in mind. "
2992450,57989144,2015-12-31,28580637,Betty,"The apartment was centrally located near all the night life in Albany, ideally suited to the age profile of my 2 sons who stayed their. ... We had initial difficulty in contacting the host...until we used my son who lives in Albany to be the contact, as we were relying on internet connection where ever we found free wifi..as roaming charges for international tourists is prohibitive. He went to the apartment a few times on the day we were yo arrive into JFK bit could not gain access...he was trying to get key so that he could leave basic provisions for us there. He eventually got an answer to the door bell..late evening.  The apartment was adequate for them as they spent most of their time with their brother who lives in Albany. They did say that the apartment was way too warm, and they could not see where to set the heating. One of the windows was broken but had plastic/perspex over it. The furniture was of a good enough standard but the couch was a little shabby and their was a musty smell from it. Other than those  facts they said the place was ideal for them and the contact person was very obliging considering they locked themselves out once and needed access ."
2992450,457366954464901293,2021-09-22,413779309,Carolina,The place is clean and the host is very nice
2992450,695544085190177036,2022-08-17,19928494,Kyle,It was much dirtier in person and half the furniture was broken. Hopefully the host can fix these issues because the apartment could be nice if it is cleaned up correctly and furnished with items that weren’t all broken such as the Tv being propped up on a table with two screws.
3820211,17665203,2014-08-15,11024290,Abigail,We had a marvelous time staying at Terra's beautiful apartment in downtown Albany.  The location was perfect and the apartment was just splendid.  Terra was very responsive to our inquiries and flexible.  Could not have been happier.
3820211,18213336,2014-08-23,2698205,Beth,Terra was super welcoming and accommodating! Apartment was as pictured and the center square neighborhood is just steps outside your door - as is a bus stop to help you get around the city if you are visiting without a car. If you are a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs to dampen the possible noise from the outdoor space at the bar in back of the apartment. Other than that- it was a good central spot to spend a night or two in town. 
3820211,18641356,2014-08-29,16365680,Carlos,"Muy bien ubicado, limpio y acogedor. Es una antigua comisaría de policía."
3820211,18776733,2014-08-31,17492601,Rory Adele,"Our original plans for a place to stay fell through at 11pm the night before we were due to leave. Terra was more than accommodating and I woke up in the morning to see that she had accepted our request for the next day! 
<br/>
<br/>The apartment was in a great location, very nicely presented and really home-y! Throughout our short stay Terra checked in a few times to see if we had any questions or if there was anything we needed, which was very appreciated. 
<br/>
<br/>Since this was the most seamless and convenient booking we've ever dealt with we are already hoping that we'll be able to stay again when we have future events in the area! "
3820211,19110185,2014-09-06,19139729,Harriett Jordan,"Terra was a great host, super informative, and flexible with our arrival time.  The place has been newly renovated and was really stunning. We were in walking distance from a great sushi place and a really beautiful dog park.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed the urban setting and had a blast!  I would remind future guests that this is an urban apartment and next door is a restaurant/ bar."
3820211,19235465,2014-09-08,6487329,Merijn,"The place is even bigger than on the photos. Terra was real easy to communicate with. The location is great, near restaurants and bars. We had a good time there."
3820211,19761821,2014-09-17,21319938,Matt,"Unfortunately I could only stay for one night but Terra was an extremely accommodating host. She met me to exchange the keys with just short notice ahead of time by text and was very nice. The apartment was clean, spacious and updated. Also, the neighborhood with a multitude of bars and restaurants was great. I would highly recommend Terra and her executive suite."
3820211,19835853,2014-09-19,17274817,Shahadat,"Our very short stay at Terra's was very nice. She was accommodating and nice. We really liked the place, and the reserved parking was super helpful."
3820211,20512666,2014-09-30,1771665,Susan,"This is a cute little place in the middle of the city that blends historic & modern touches.  The historic building is very cool & still has fixtures from when it was a police precinct.  That there is off-street parking is a big plus. The neighborhood is quite walkable & there's lots of little restaurants.  The Capital District has many activities: parks, the Hudson River, Erie Canal & the Baseball Hall of Fame is a nice day trip. Being that it is in the middle of the city, there is the typical city noise & a bar next door so if you are a light sleeper, that may be a consideration.  Terra was very easygoing & as helpful as we needed. They even came by and installed an extra bar to hang clothes on in the closet.
<br/>The kitchen was well appointed as well as the bath. "
3820211,20622110,2014-10-02,5197373,Adrienne,"The apartment was clean, nice & convenient. I felt safe & was able to walk wherever I needed to. <br/>Terra was a good host & was there to meet me on time & was extremely flexible. I will stay here again the next time I'm in Albany!"
3820211,20703385,2014-10-04,4015110,Xavier,"Terra was an excellent host. Easily accessible if needed. extremely nice place and very convenient. Next to transportation, food, and much more amenities nearby. "
3820211,21040844,2014-10-10,17457569,Phil,"We had a marvelous stay, and Terra was a very accommodating host. The apartment was quite spacious, and we could't have wanted a more convenient location. We were delighted to find a bookshelf with books and DVDs that we could use, and the kitchen had everything that we needed for breakfast. Terra promptly remediated our few, minor complaints: nighttime noise from a neighboring business and weak WiFi signal in the living area. We would certainly stay there again and recommend it to others."
3820211,21138885,2014-10-12,1301177,Jeff,"Very comfortable apartment and super central to all the shops and restaurants on Lark St. Terra was great - responsive, friendly and flexible. After she showed us around the apartment, she even left us a bottle of wine that she had just opened up! Would recommend to visitors to the Capital Region."
3820211,21329373,2014-10-14,8115792,Kelly,"Terra was awesome! She is very accommodating, sincere and helpful. I had some unexpected changes in my travel plans and she was incredibly understanding and helpful, which to me means a lot. The apartment itself is awesome. Comfy, cozy and cute. I enjoyed walking around the corner to a great coffee shop and a great place with smoothies and green juices. I recommend this place for anyone considering, the owner will surely make you feel at home."
3820211,21735389,2014-10-22,228283,Stefan,"Terra's apartment is in a great location of Albany, bars, restaurants and coffee shops are within walking distance. The apartment is in a renovated building which used to be a police headquarters so the rooms have high ceilings which give them a lofty feel. The living area is spacious and there's a large kitchen area with breakfast bar. What I liked most about the apartment was the comfy bed. Terra was very friendly and check-in was no problem, unfortunately I didn't get to meet her in person. Remember that this apartment is not on a quiet residential street - but you get free off street parking and you can enjoy downtown on foot without having to worry about driving. "
3820211,21769713,2014-10-23,4961241,Linda,"Terra responded promptly to my request for accommodation. We were pleasantly surprised to discover our apartment is in a restored historic building in a neighborhood of well cared for historic homes.  Terra greeted us on arrival and provided information about the apartment and the neighborhood. The apartment is tastefully decorated preserving the charm of the building. Spotlessly clean, warm, and no problem with noise. Tourist destinations are easily walkable. I only regret we did not have more time in Albany. Thank you Terra for hosting us."
3820211,22397578,2014-11-05,8813783,Daniel,"The apartment was clean, neat and well presented.  The apartment is in a very nice neighbourhood of Albany and I found to be quite safe, even at night.  The bed was extremely comfortable, to a point that I missed my alarms and my train back to NYC haha!  Although I didn't meet Terra, her communication was impeccable and would happily stay at the property again.  My only concern was that the WiFi was pretty poor and I found that the signal was better when you were further away from the router which is strange, something which probably needs to be addressed.  Apart from that it was awesome!!"
3820211,22448483,2014-11-06,22883442,Karl,Terra is wonderfully sweet and helpful. She has life figured out better than most of us and her apartments are beautiful. The neighborhood is very nice too. You are right on Lark so you can walk to a dozen or more decent places to eat and and drink and if you are inclined you could walk to down town and check the scene there.
3820211,22550507,2014-11-09,3105435,Nicole,"Our favourite place to stay in Albany! The place is even more lovely than the photos. We had a wonderful stay here and Terra was very hospitable. Although I came in late, she made time to meet me with the key and very promptly tackled a faulty internet connection when I let her know it was down.
<br/>
<br/>Also, the coffee and packets of oatmeal were a welcome surprise and thoughtful touch.
<br/>
<br/>Definitely recommend the place if you're looking for a clean, comfortable place to relax within walking distance to all kinds of great Albany spots. "
3820211,22743743,2014-11-13,22289023,Mark,"Terra was very welcoming and property was very neat and tidy. Well located to Lark Street where there is an excellent coffee shop ( Stacks ) also good restaurants
<br/>Property has been renovated with excellent taste"
3820211,23016025,2014-11-20,1615259,Benjamen,"This is a wonderful, cute apartment in a fantastic location. It's within walking distance of a number of restaurants, bars and stores. The apartment itself was clean and well-equipped with a full kitchen, coffee maker and living room. The bedroom was comfy and the bathroom was nice and clean.
<br/>
<br/>Terra was a great host and was responsive throughout our stay. We would love to stay here again next time we are in the Albany area."
3820211,23038071,2014-11-21,19452290,Mirnes,Terra was extremely flexible about our stay as we were arriving very late due to traffic getting out of Manhattan.  She was great to communicate with and made the process effortless.  The apartment is immaculate and in a great location!
3820211,23165706,2014-11-24,10734365,Patricia,"Terra met me when I arrived and gave me a tour of the apartment and the whole building. This is a historical building and the apartment is newly renovated and very comfortable.  It is located in the middle of a neighborhood of parks, art galleries and restaurants.   Terra provided us with useful information about the city and the neighborhood.  It was a bitterly cold weekend and she was very responsive to our request for a bit more heat.  "
3820211,23329564,2014-11-29,16928219,Karen,"The apartment was great! My in-laws stayed for two nights while visiting and loved it. Perfect for a couple, close to the action on Lark St, and the off street parking spot was clutch! We will definitely use the apartment in the future if it's available! "
3820211,24022288,2014-12-17,27719,Eleanor,Very convenient location close to Empire State Plaza and downtown as well as lots of restaurants along Lark Street. Nicely remodeled with a great kitchen. Would definitely stay here again if I come back to Albany. 
3820211,24317066,2014-12-25,24794099,Serge,"Fantastic place, fantastic host. "
3820211,24371260,2014-12-27,23790695,Caitlin,"We had a great visit! Terra was very welcoming and responsive to our needs prior to and during the visit. The apartment has all the essentials for a great stay and the location was top notch near local bars, grocery store, convenience stores, indie theatre, coffee shops, parks, etc. We had a terrific visit and will definitely consider staying again when back in town. Highly recommended!"
3820211,24684113,2015-01-01,8773106,Molly,"Staying at Terra's was the perfect escape we needed. She was wonderful to communicate with from the first interaction on and her beautiful apartment couldn't have been nicer. It is very tastefully decorated and tidy in a prime neighborhood and it even had parking! We would love to come back another time- it is a perfect, homey spot; recommended to all."
3820211,30052621,2015-04-16,15062743,Macy,"A++ AWESOME Place to stay in Albany. This apartment has all the amenities and very close to many many restaurants and shops. Even has laundry in the apartment. Perfect place to stay, central location, fun, parking and laundry. All Perfect. "
3820211,30162469,2015-04-18,5977819,Ben,"Terra's apartment is great -- it has everything you need, is clean, and is in a good location.   As a host, Terra was wonderful and very accommodating / accessible.  I highly recommend staying here."
3820211,30345819,2015-04-20,30907110,Morgan,"Terra's apartment was very clean and tastefully furnished. Modern with high ceilings and a roomy feel. Comfortable bed and fluffy white towels. The free off street parking was a much needed amenity. Everything we wanted was in walking distance. Washington Park and the Empire Plaza. Good food, coffee, and even a supermarket. It is a busy city area so you can hear the noises of the city but the building is solid and does a good job to muffle it. The building has good security and we felt safe. Terra replied to our questions promptly and made us feel welcome. We hope to return in the near future."
3820211,30472949,2015-04-22,3672607,Heather,The area was perfect and the space was lovely.  I would absolutely stay here again.
3820211,30748739,2015-04-26,31850946,Aurelia,"Clean, comfortable and well located. "
3820211,30963305,2015-04-29,2535580,Dorsey,"Terra's apartment is comfortable, functional, and centrally located for short walks to many locations of interest in Albany, as well as dining options.  Nearly everything you could need is within a few blocks. <br/>"
3820211,31139264,2015-05-02,5941897,Kathleen,"We arrived to a clean apartment, with beer and water waiting, which was great. Also, the parking pass was amazing, and it is a fantastic location — so easy to get around. At night, it is loud, though. The bedroom is next to the patio of an animated bar, and it doesn't die down until after 2am on the weekend."
3820211,31479152,2015-05-05,31730532,Amy,"Terra was extremely easy and accommodating to work with. She was very responsive when I had questions, as it was my first time using Airbnb. The apartment was very clean and comfortable and having off street parking was very helpful!"
3820211,31604605,2015-05-07,4213802,Craig,"Lovely apartment located close to nearby parks and shops.  The flat was great... Clean, modern and had everything we needed.  Recommended to all."
3820211,31810774,2015-05-10,31107234,Garson,It was our first experience using airbnb. Terra clearly demonstrated that this business model works! She is very responsive and warm. Made us feel like right at home. The place is very clean and comfortable. Location is perfect and included parking is a big plus. Highly recommended!
3820211,32072682,2015-05-13,31546205,Daniel,"Terra was great -- It was my first time using AirBnB and I asked her about 200 questions.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment was really nice - it's located next to a bunch of restaurants and bars.  I only stopped in for one night but was able to get a nice meal and a good beer.
<br/>
<br/>Onsite parking was really convenient.  "
3820211,32354040,2015-05-17,29100058,Rachel,Terra is great - very helpful and communicative. The apartment is clean and comfortable. We felt very much at home.
3820211,32988921,2015-05-24,6991032,Amy,"I loved this little apartment - very clean and comfortable, great location right near beautiful Washington Park. Great towels! You can't adjust the thermostat yourself, and the windows don't open; there was a bit of a problem my first couple of days when the a/c wasn't getting into the apartment, but Terra was great about fixing the problem quickly. After that, the temp was great in the apt. and I had no problems. The bedroom does back onto the patio of a bar, so bring ear plugs. The noise goes on all night. It's a downside to being so central.  With earplugs, it was fine. "
3820211,34027454,2015-06-03,24670114,Mia,"Very nice and convenient place to stay. Everything travelers might need is near by. Good restaurants are in a walking distance. Parking is also convenient, and the apartment itself has a clean and beautiful setting. I enjoyed staying in the apartment. "
3820211,34756306,2015-06-11,1007045,Alex,Terra was an excellent host and her place was super convenient and comfortable. Absolutely recommend staying there.
3820211,34916499,2015-06-13,35329229,Jacob,"Awesome place, very clean, wifi, TV, full kitchen. What more could you want. Great location with some really good restaurants near by. I went to Shogun which is a sushi/Thai place literally across the street and it was super great. If I'm ever in Albany again I would definitely stay with Terra. A++ "
3820211,35468060,2015-06-19,10103349,Courtney,"the place was exactly as described and shown in the pictures- very modern and very clean. the location is great and centrally located to everything in Albany, and the parking was a major plus! as other people had mentioned it did get a little loud later on in the night as the bedroom is next to the patio of a bar but it honestly didn't bother us at all. Terra was a great host and very quick to respond with any questions we had, would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay here! "
3820211,35749883,2015-06-21,15812257,Matthew,"Fantastic place with a lot of character! Nice and spacious with all you need for a comfortable stay. Also, there was a mixup on calendars due to an issue with airbnb, but Terra was super accommodating and met us shortly after we arrived in Albany. Very conveniently located to many things - Washington park, lark street, etc. only downside is that the nearby bar can get a little rowdy at night, but I would definitely stay again."
3820211,35980555,2015-06-23,35997102,Murray,Terra was a fantastic host. Very accommodating and easy to contact. The listing was accurate and we loved the place. The neighborhood was comfortable and had good access by foot to everything one could need.
3820211,36066543,2015-06-24,2534896,Marion,"We really enjoyed our stay at Terra's apartment, the place is great as well as the location.
<br/>There was a little misunderstanding with the check-out time but Terra was very nice about it and made sure everything worked for everyone. 
<br/>I really recommend staying there!"
3820211,36354305,2015-06-27,34963458,Jason,"Terra was amazing and so was her place. The bed felt like sleeping on clouds, now I feel like I need a new bed. The place is completely remodeled and beautiful.  Like the 1 reviewer said the place is by a bar but with the fan provided I had no issue falling asleep. The place is right the middle of everything and walking distance to the egg.  I would 100% stay here again. Like the place terra the host is amazing. "
3820211,36465495,2015-06-28,36235135,Paula,"My stay at Terra's place was everything that I was looking for and more! Terra made sure we were settled in and had everything we needed. The apartment was just as pictured, with beautiful clean rooms and in a great location. Our stay couldn't have been better!"
3820211,36774627,2015-07-01,2176456,Tamiko,"The apartment was clean and comfortable. Excellent location close to lots of restaurants and groceries. Parking was easy. Terra was great to work with. Would definitely recommend it, but do bring ear plugs as it is close to a bar. 
<br/>"
3820211,37086298,2015-07-04,31246473,Clara,I stayed at Terra's place over the 4th of July weekend. The apartment was clean and quite nice. It was so nice having access to the washer and dryer right there in the apartment. Terra was a lovely host and very accommodating. I would recommend staying here if you are traveling in the Albany area. The apartment is located right in the middle of the local night life and we really had such a nice time there. 
3820211,37963278,2015-07-12,31657292,Lisa Marie,"Terra was very accommodating - check-in and check-out times were flexible. The apartment was much more than what I expected - it was well-kept and had state-of-the-art utilities that made my stay very comfortable. The surrounding buildings are commercial establishments and can be a bit noisy on weekends, but I did not mind so much. The location was ideal - it was just a few blocks away from very good restaurants (Mexican food/ Japanese food), from a grocery store, and from The Egg. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to visit Albany. "
3820211,38347381,2015-07-14,9507120,Katherine,"Terra's place was clean, beautiful and perfectly located in central Albany. I would highly recommend it!"
3820211,38470625,2015-07-15,26270538,Jonathan,Great location and a wonderful experience overall!
3820211,38533079,2015-07-16,36954633,Shahid,Terra was very responsive to my questions. She was a great host. The place is very well kept and my stay was comfortable. Location also worked out for me perfectly.
3820211,38655023,2015-07-17,36432241,Carolyn,"We were very happy with our stay at Terra's. Our arrival time was up in the air and Terra was very accommodating to that. The apartment was great and it was helpful to have all of the kitchen amenities and parking right outside. We didn't get to explore the city, though we found a great coffee shop a few blocks down and found the neighborhood to be nice. I was concerned about the noise from the bar which is right outside the apartment, but the white noise machine completely drowned it out. It was not a detriment to our stay at all. We would definitely stay again!"
3820211,38712860,2015-07-18,5083289,Mike,"Terra's place was wonderful. Located in a prime location, the renal was walking distance to everything: nightlife, restaurants, and coffee shops. The rental is as-pictured and was very spacious and comfortable. Terra's communication was on-point and made it very easy for us to check-in and out. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
3820211,39405684,2015-07-23,20017356,Michael,Great location and easy coordinating w host 
3820211,40340886,2015-07-30,25365507,Alexandria,I was there for only a few days but felt so at home right when I got there. I had a great experience and it's in a great neighborhood. Lots of bars and restaurants a few steps outside the door. 
3820211,41712793,2015-08-08,15092137,Darren,"Terra was a great host. Super easy checkin, easy access to private parking area, and great location just off Lark."
3820211,42874285,2015-08-16,17760463,Lex,"Our visit to Albany was made absolutely perfect by this wonderful Airbnb. Terra is delightful and promptly responsive to messages and questions. The apartment super clean, stylish, and surprisingly roomy. Lots of wonderful small touches, too, like plenty of towels, candles, an amazing caldelabra, and lots of kitchen and bathroom accoutrements. The neighborhood is fantastic. If you like an eclectic environment with loads of restaurants, pubs, galleries, and artisan studios, you'll love this wonderful property. Thanks, Terra, for making our weekend spectacular!"
3820211,43340461,2015-08-18,41581637,Melissa,"This was my first time using Airbnb and thanks to Terra it won't be my last. Terra was a fantastic host. She is extremely responsive and very accommodating. Her apartment was absolutely gorgeous and very clean. The area was also great; everything you could possibly want is within walking distance (dining, bars, grocery store, dry cleaners, park, etc). The best part is that the apt came with parking which is very hard to come by in the area. Thanks for being such an incredible host. "
3820211,43435979,2015-08-19,22243253,Anastasia,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The bed was very cozy! The host provides very soft towels,  toiletries, coffee and tea. Would definitely stay here again. Great location!"

3820211,44506170,2015-08-26,1473789,Michelle,"This was a great stay. Location was surrounded by cafes and restaurants, and the place decor was as pictured. Terra is a great communicator and no issues at all with the stay. :)"
3820211,45117311,2015-08-31,39400842,Ryan,Overall excellent experience. Very clean apartment and its located close to restaurants and a few bars too. Terra was kind and accommodating and cared about our time there.
3820211,45636788,2015-09-04,41055910,Emily,"Terra's apartment was a great fit for 2 people. Apartment was lovely and clean. We worked from the apartment in the morning, wifi connection was strong and living room was a great space to work in.  While we didnt actually meet Terra, she was easy to get in touch with prior to arrival. The neighborhood was very walkable and had some great cafes and bars available."
3820211,45803771,2015-09-06,2215005,Julie,We stayed 2 nights at Terra's place and it was great! Communication by text was super easy and check-in was seamless. The place is beautiful and we felt right at home. 
3820211,46431924,2015-09-10,14125920,Yan,Nice room good location. 
3820211,46633751,2015-09-12,13040325,Renvie,"What a great apartment, Terra was very quick to respond to my texts and/or emails. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone.  The apartment itself my husband and I fell in love with, it's very beautiful and we really couldn't believe it was once a police precinct.  God willing my husband gets the job he wants, I will definitely stay here again when I need to go visit him. Thanks Terra for everything !"
3820211,47235394,2015-09-16,22905161,Jeff,"I enjoyed my time here. All in all, clean, secure, and comfortable. A good place to stay. Just a heads up, the bar next door can be a little noisy. I'm a heavy sleeper and slept fine, but it would be a nuisance if you're not. "
3820211,47360283,2015-09-18,801808,Carol,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Terra's apartment.  It was centrally located and I was able to walk to Albany's capital and museum.  It was immaculate and very attractive.  I wished my husband would have been with me to enjoy the ambiance of a private apartment with very comfortable bed, large bath and lovely kitchen."
3820211,47483174,2015-09-19,26905377,Zulma,Terra's place was very comfortable and clean. The communication worked perfectly through the airbnb website. No issues checking in or out. I am very happy this (my second airbnb) experience was great.
3820211,48066501,2015-09-23,10931980,Molly,Terra checked in throughout our stay and was warm and welcoming.  The apartment is one of six in an historic police precinct--very up-to-date and charming at the same time.   Exceeded our expectations.
3820211,48236755,2015-09-24,32495737,Greg,Good location and fairy priced. 
3820211,48508593,2015-09-27,8701852,Cherry,"I went to Albany to do research at the New York State Library & Archives. Terra's place was in the perfect location to do that, a short and easy walk away. It was wonderfully spacious, brightly lit and had everything I needed for my short stay. Texts with Terra helped me figure out the few questions I had: where to find light switches and a grocery story. I was very comfortable there, and comfortable with the neighborhood, realizing a little too late that there were areas right around the corner on Lark Street that would have been very fun to explore.
<br/>My very first impressions were a bit tainted by the fact that I arrived late, after dark, and wasn't familiar with the city, making the location difficult to find: the street is small and busy (at that moment at least, including emergency vehicles amassed just down the street), and it was difficult to read the house numbers while driving. That meant I had to drive around, negotiating unusually unforgiving one way streets, before I figured out 1) where the building was and 2) where to park. 
<br/>Once there, the din in the neighborhood was impressive! Criminy, this is only Thursday, I thought. It turns out, though, that Thursday night is Karaoke night at the bar just on the other side of the bedroom window. Happily, Friday and Saturday nights were oasis(s?) of peace by comparison.
<br/>Overall, I enjoyed my stay and felt happily at home, and would go back. "
3820211,48978040,2015-09-29,4191589,Jude,This place was great! Clean modern and right in fun Albany location!<br/>I used to live a few houses down and it brought back great memories!<br/>I would stay there any time!
3820211,49228816,2015-10-02,39957503,Jerry,Terra was a great host and easy to communicate with. Her place is conveniently located close to the Egg and there are several restaurants and a nice coffee house nearby.
3820211,49429850,2015-10-04,30323291,Michael,"This place is legit. Parking spot was super convenient, everything was clean, and I felt right at home. Terra is also a sweetie pie and was so pleasant to talk to. Get on this before it's too late!"
3820211,49792440,2015-10-06,42468134,Laurie,"Terra made the apt available to me much sooner than expected. The apt itself had everything I could want or need.  With my loved ones so close, this airbnb is a godsend. I would definitely rent again.
<br/>"
3820211,50464634,2015-10-12,20805065,Sue,"The apartment was great - fantastic space, with soaps, shampoo, tea, coffee and cereal generously  provided."
3820211,50838966,2015-10-15,600313,Pam,"A really cute little apartment. Didn't realize until the morning it is an old police precinct!<br/>Clean, good restaurants nearby.<br/>Enjoyed our stay. "
3820211,50977312,2015-10-16,44876419,Maya,"Loved the place, loved the neighborhood, and Terra was a great host and easy to communicate with. Would enjoy staying here again."
3820211,51026931,2015-10-17,40402792,Kristin,"Terra did a fantastic job of hosting us while we stayed in Albany for the night!  We checked in late and left early in the morning, but she helped make our transition seamless.  We LOVED her place and the location!  It was also nice to have our own parking spot on site.  Would definitely recommend this place to others!  The building is really cool! "
3820211,51113434,2015-10-18,10846248,Janet,"Loved this apartment.  Very comfortable for 2 people.  Everything spotless, super comfortable bed, great shower, coffee and nice teas, even milk in the fridge.  Terra was a breeze to communicate with - absolutely no problems.  Great location.  Enjoyed walking in Washington Park (1 block away). Really good food in town also."
3820211,51689464,2015-10-24,1368149,Monica,"Terra was a wonderful hostess, though I didn't meet her in person.  I got to the building tired and bedraggled from travel and got stuck outside the door because I couldn't make the code work in the door.  Terra was right there helping me through it and when I got into the apartment and it was a bit chilly (first cold day of the year), she provided me with a space heater just in case.  The apartment was sparkling clean and actually looked even nicer and bigger than the pictures.  I ate at a couple of neighborhood restaurants (a Jamaican take out across the street was especially friendly and delicious).  It's a neighborhood that is on it's way up and I felt safe there especially before dark as a single female.  Thanks, Terra!"
3820211,52121130,2015-10-26,4689466,Victoria,"The apartment is lovely and comfortable--I was in town the night before a job interview, and it was a perfect and central setting to relax in.  Terra was not available for check-in, but she left me detailed instructions which allowed me to check in with no problems at all.  The apartment is well supplied with basics (coffee, tea, oatmeal, shampoo, conditioner) which made my life much easier.  Others have mentioned noise in their reviews, and Terra made sure I knew that before booking.  There was some street noise last night, but nothing beyond what you'd expect in a city and certainly nothing that kept me up.  I would go back again in a heartbeat!"
3820211,52447287,2015-10-29,6368737,Owen,"A beautiful apartment with really (like, noticeably) high ceilings, all in a gorgeous old building on a nice street.  We had a great stay and would come back in a heartbeat."
3820211,52487305,2015-10-30,6491836,Damon,"Great 1 bedroom rental! Located in a great neighborhood. Cozy, clean and easy to communicate with the host."
3820211,53522856,2015-11-09,38614095,Julia,"Terra was communicative and helpful through checking in and out. The apartment was very clean, private and the locale was central and convenient. Definitely made our stay in Albany comfortable.  "
3820211,53670093,2015-11-10,12112084,Curtis,Terra's place was perfect! The neighborhood was really fun and in a great location. The apartment was super clean and comfortable and check in/out was really easy. Great communication and really easy to work with! Would love to stay again!
3820211,53712728,2015-11-11,47772007,Ani,The apartment was perfect for 2 of us. The big kitchen was great for cooking and had everything we needed. Terra was a very responsive and awesome host even though we didn't get to meet her in person. Will definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in the Albany area. 
3820211,53843948,2015-11-13,46183199,Aos,"The listing was as described. It is quite a lovely home with nice high ceilings as have been noted before. The furniture is nice and clean. Everything really is clean and smells fresh. Terra was not there to greet me, but that is OK; she is very responsive by text messaging. You should know that the apartment is on a busy street and there are bars and restaurants close by, so there is some music/noise. I am usually sensitive to that, but I really slept like a baby because the bedroom is pretty quiet. "
3820211,56760176,2015-12-17,14516997,Drew,"Terra,
<br/>Thank you for the great place. It was clean and comfortable. The location was very convenient.

3820211,57138174,2015-12-22,48519288,Vincent,This was a very nice apartment in a decent part of town. Parking was right there as well. Terra was a great host and there were no issues getting the keys/etc. I would recommend this place if you're in Albany. There does appear to be a bar back yard right outside the bedroom so there could be noise from smokers however. There was a little when we stayed but it wasn't a weekend night. 
3820211,57496078,2015-12-26,1731007,Todd,Such a great and hospitable experience! Terra is lovely and knowledgeable about the Albany area. We will definitely be booking with her again the next time we need a place to stay in Albany.

3820211,59456699,2016-01-10,53501386,Stefano,"Very cool, quaint apartment near everything in Albany. Everything we need was in the apartment already.  Terra was amazing,  she was quick to respond & get us all setup. This was my first weekend using Airbnb, I'm just hoping every other host is just like Terra. Can not say enough good things about her & our stay.  Thank you so much. You're the best"
3820211,59623965,2016-01-12,2535580,Dorsey,"Great apartment, fantastic location.  Well equipped for a comfortable and convenient stay in downtown Albany. "
3820211,59662127,2016-01-13,11459211,Josh,"Terra was a very nice host and easy to communicate with. Her place is clean, spacious and ideally located - right off of the best street for activity in Albany and in walking distance to the state capitol. I would recommend to anyone looking for centrally located accommodation in Albany. "
3820211,59867680,2016-01-16,2165020,Samantha,"Terra's place was great! We stopped over for a short overnight trip on the way up North. It was perfectly located, very clean and cool (really neat building).  The parking spot was extremely convenient too. Terra was very helpful."

3820211,60748314,2016-01-26,31296418,Shannon,"This apartment was an ideal stay for us during our short visit to Albany.  Walking distance to some really cool sights, great restaurants and coffee shops.  We felt safe walking at night with our toddler.  Terra was a great host - responsive and quick to accept our last minute request to stay here.  Very clean space with everything we could want or need - even some interesting books to read to our son at bedtime."
3820211,61264369,2016-02-01,32702452,Chris,Place was exactly like it is pictured and in the best part of town! I grew up in a city and since have moved away to rural NY. It was wonderful to see local pubs and sushi practically outside my window at this apartment. One of the best places I've stayed without a doubt!
3820211,61339112,2016-02-02,11459211,Josh,This is the second time I've stayed at Terra's place and it was just a good as the first. She's an great and reliable host!
3820211,61730901,2016-02-07,15976583,Kimberly,"Terra's place was great and in a prime location.  She provided very simple self-check in instructions and was very responsive, kind and flexible throughout our stay.

<br/>Go for it!!"
3820211,62281520,2016-02-13,6491836,Damon,We met Terra and had a great conversation. It was our second time staying there. We love to stay at the apartment every time we come to Albany to see a show. The egg is very close. We got to see an great show. The pizza place across the street is great. It is open late too. The apartment is always nice to have some pizza and a good nights sleep.
3820211,62364177,2016-02-14,16992540,Sarah,"I could tell Tara was a very friendly person from her first message to me. On the Sat. we were going to check in Tara informed us that there was a plumming problem in the apartment and we were not going to be able to stay there. We're pretty laid back people so we were open to her suggestion of staying at her ""Inn"" not far from the apartment and we're so glad we did! It was in a great location, and we have the opportunity to meet really fun people. Tara and her husband even gave us a ride in their car to our downtown dinner appointment. They were very gracious and we would love to stay with them again."
3820211,63112687,2016-02-20,57674849,Jacqueline,Our stay at this apartment was easy and convenient. Terra made checking in very simple and was very accomodating. The apartment itself was a perfect location for our trip and it was awesome to have a parking spot in that particular neighborhood in Albany. The apartment was cute and surpassed our needs. Next time we are in Albany we will definitely be looking to stay here over getting a hotel. 
3820211,63610092,2016-02-25,7044835,Judy,"I had an excellent stay here during my trip to Albany. Terra was very helpful and responded to my queries very fast. The apartment was very cosy, spacious and Terra left a lot of useful things like cooking necessities, extra toilet rolls, chargers which are small gestures but made a lot of difference. I would definitely recommend a stay here and will come back myself if I come to Albany again! =)"
3820211,63849489,2016-02-27,48285389,Daniel,Terra was awesome. She made sure every thing was all set and ready to go. The area was amazing with anything you could need. I definitely recommend this place!
3820211,69525457,2016-04-11,25109073,Heather,"Terra's place was great - perfect size for my boyfriend and me on a laid back weekend in Albany.  Close to so many great things we were able to walk everywhere.  Terra was a fantastic host - answered all questions quickly and thought of everything we'd need.  The apartment is clean, full of light and all amenities you'd need.  I would highly recommend staying here and we will definitely be back."
3820211,70856253,2016-04-21,1471878,James,I requested the reservation very late due to a flight cancellation.  Terra saved the day.  The apartment was great and in a very cool historic property.  The location is perfect; lots of food/cocktail/coffee options. 
3820211,71108819,2016-04-23,23246263,Jake,"My visit here was nothing less than amazing.  Although I contacted Terra on a relatively short notice, (only a couple hours before my planned arrival) she was very accommodating and helpful.  She even offered to help me with apartment hunting, which was the reason I was in town.  Getting into the apartment was a synch as well, very simple and straightforward. Overall, the apartment was a delight and is exactly as pictured. Great experience! "

3820211,72146635,2016-05-01,6185978,Brenda,"Beautiful apt to stay in Albany. We were visiting some friends that lived in the neighborhood and wanted something that was walking distance to their apt- not only was it walking distance to their apt but also walking distance to lots of cute coffee shops, bars restaurants, and cool landmarks. The apt was really clean and Terra was really great about communicating how to check-in/out of the apt. Would stay here again when we visit Albany again. "

The apartment was just as depicted and the private off-street parking was a real plus.  We were in touch by text when we arrived and  again when we left. So much nicer than staying in a hotel, my husband and I also took Terra's recommendation and got some take out from the Jamaican restaurant across the street!  
<br/>
<br/>Thank you so much Terra - it was awesome!"

3820211,88581213,2016-07-24,19527110,Robert,"Terra's communication was great in the weeks leading up to our stay, which was important because of the impending NY legislation regarding Airbnb. The space itself also served our needs well. Would definitely stay again if we find ourselves back in Albany."

3820211,146372642,2017-04-22,15583543,Darcy,There is a bar right outside the bedroom window so if you are not planning on staying out late it is very loud. The apartment is very clean and nicely furnished and the bed is very comfortable. The location is great for going out. 
3820211,192550576,2017-09-10,44211416,Alexandra,"Terra is a fabulous host, extremely communicative and attentive to guests needs. Apartment is very well located close to the capital buildings, restaurants, etc"

3820211,194024902,2017-09-15,3814227,Paul,"Nice place, very homey with ample books and dvds, comfortably furnish and very nice kitchen. Noise sensitive people may night like busy neighborhood but if you want to be downtown it's awesome."
3820211,195275802,2017-09-18,356567,Joshua,"A great apartment in a fun neighborhood. Not for the noise sensitive, but I don't mind when I'm traveling for leisure. Other than that, the apartment is centrally located, super clean and very spacious. Communication with the hosts was easy. I would stay here again when I return to Albany."
3820211,196018107,2017-09-21,79646229,Gwen,"What a great little place! Clean, a bit quirky, great bed, comfy, books and movies... next time I hope to have my honey with me so we can walk around to the bars and restaurants. Will definitely stay again."
3820211,197037620,2017-09-24,6280370,Michael,"Terra's apartment was great. The location was perfect, within walking distance to restaurants and nightlife on Lark or Times Union Center, the Egg and Empire plaza. Her check-in  instructions were  complete and helpful. There is a bar next door and it was busy on Saturday night, but it didn't bother us."

3820211,200776035,2017-10-06,2219879,Nicole,Spacious and central to many places to eat and grab a drink - lively neighborhood. Loved the refurbished historical building that the apartment is located in. Thanks!
3820211,201092572,2017-10-07,28754501,Francis,Location is great but noisy avenue in front. Communication was easy and with details.
3820211,201523488,2017-10-08,22507157,Sage,Great space and location for our overnight trip to Albany.
3820211,203205116,2017-10-14,151702846,Mariam,This is my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience. Terra's place is close to variety of restaurants and convenient stores and it is 10 min away from the Empire Estate Plaza. Also terra response really quickly to any of my questions and she's a great help during my stay.

3820211,206934585,2017-10-27,3708719,Brendan,"This place is in an awesome location, around the corner from our favorite restaurants, cool shops and bars. The place itself is incredibly comfortable, well appointed, stylish, and clean. Very easy access, and with a great parking spot. Only issue, as others mention, is noise. Bar right next to the bedroom. Ear plugs and white-noise app on the cell phone made it ok."
3820211,207601256,2017-10-29,56656035,Alex,We love this place and hope to return yet again.
3820211,209924843,2017-11-06,36247556,Ryan,"The apartment was clean, comfortable and located near fun bars/restaurants. Exactly what we needed. Bed is super comfy and shower is good. Would book again."
3820211,210287552,2017-11-08,75079874,Matt,Nice clean place only a shot walk from the park and many other attractions. I would defiantly consider staying here again.
3820211,210851465,2017-11-11,369548,Ryan,"Great, spacious apartment in a convenient location for visiting Albany. The adjacent street has lots of nice dining and shopping spots. The bar next store didn't really bother us at night. The hosts were both responsive and accommodating."
3820211,212005265,2017-11-15,62048125,Ethan,"I only stayed one night but this place was great!  I would echo what others have said - the place is clean and close to a lot of places in the city and I liked the decor.<br/>I should note that, from my personal experience, the on-site parking is not necessarily guaranteed.  When I arrived, there was a car already parked in my designated parking spot, which surprised me.  I asked Terra what I should do but didn't get a reply at the moment (although given that I asked her around midnight, I know that was a shot in the dark).  Thus, I had to drive around for a bit and find street parking elsewhere.  The next day, she responded near check-out time as follows: ""Should only have been a temporary violator. We get those in urban environs.""<br/>This was kind of a bummer because (1) even if it was temporary, it doesn't really do anyone any good because you can't be expected to sit around for an indefinite period of time until the violator moves their car or it gets towed; and (2) I picked this listing in part because I was relying on the fact that there would be on-site parking available and was hoping to avoid exactly the kind of scenario I encountered.  <br/>I understand that Terra cannot control all the cars that come and go in her parking lot and don't fault her for that.  However, I would have appreciated if the Airbnb listing indicated clearly that parking violators can be expected and that parking is not guaranteed so that I would have been better informed when making my choice.<br/>Anyway, that's the only issue I had.  Other than that, it was an enjoyable stay!"
3820211,212397100,2017-11-17,187912,Erin,"Never thought I'd say this, but I wish I could have stayed longer in Albany. Terra's apartment is a minute's walk to a strip of bars, restaurants, and cafes worth wiling away some time in. The apartment itself is spic and span and exactly as pictured. The bed was the comfiest I've slept in at an Airbnb. Thanks, Terra!"
3820211,212617186,2017-11-18,959047,Kathy,excellent place and excellent host. Location absolutely fantastic if you are seeing anything at the Egg which we were. Fun neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops.  Hosts very very helpful about area and fast response.

3820211,215252020,2017-11-28,42586756,Ashley,"Terra's place is awesome. Off street parking was wonderful. Close to downtown Albany, many restaurants and things to do nearby, comfortable and clean. I highly recommend it."
3820211,215946040,2017-12-02,6607698,Julie,Easy check-in process. The place was clean and as pictured. Terra was responsive with our questions. Overall it was a great stay.

3820211,220460788,2017-12-22,20413575,William,"Amazing place. I'll shocked how nice it was. Only problem is it was next to a bar. But, over all it was a good place. Would stay again."
3820211,222050310,2017-12-28,1739862,Heather,"Terra's place is very stylish, clean, and comfortable. The location was perfect, and it was a short walk to tons of restaurants and bars. We had a great stay!"
3820211,224244642,2018-01-02,69097481,Tara,We loved that this apartment is in an old precinct station and the location is perfect.  It was super easy to uber everywhere when we weren't walking.  It was a really nice stay!
3820211,224567386,2018-01-03,61720685,Candice,"This place is a gem. It is spacious, close to everything and made me feel at home."

3820211,228033142,2018-01-17,69274318,Manny,Great place and Terra was always available! Would definitely book again
3820211,228187243,2018-01-18,25245240,Ruchir,"Terra was an amazing host.  She was very responsive and helped accomadte our later arrival and departure times.  The apartment is a convient walk to many of downtown Albany's major attractions, restaurants and bars. "
3820211,228973323,2018-01-21,76614311,Tracey,Terra was very quick to respond to our questions. Her space was very clean.  Her place is centrally located and we were able to walk to all our points of interest. 
3820211,230685382,2018-01-28,111643148,Brandon,"Terra’s place was more than I expected. My time there was perfect. Check in went very smoothly as I was able to check myself in. Parking was available. The place was very clean, spacious, and really comfortable. Terra also checked on me to see if I needed anything. Would definitely recommend and stay at Terra’s again!"

3820211,231487136,2018-02-01,8197956,Lee Ann And Ken,"Terra's place was very easy to access and the parking spot was a bonus for sure.  Numerous bars, restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.  Less than a 30 minute walk to the State Capital and the Palace Theater.  Neighborhoods we walked through seemed very safe, although it was awfully cold and not too many people were out on the streets.  Terra's place was a good place to stay on a Wednesday night.  Might be a lot noisier on the weekends."
3820211,249063533,2018-04-01,86093149,Zahin,A lovely little space in a great location. Plenty of great restaurants and interesting locations in an easily walkable area.
3820211,249706361,2018-04-02,181646442,Sara,Very stylish place in a great location. It's just a walk away from local bars and restaurants. It was clean and Terra was good at communicating. Would definitely recommend to those looking for a place to stay in Albany.

3820211,258127798,2018-04-28,65139284,Loretta,"Excellent location!  Very near many eclectic restaurants on a walkable street.  Also close enough to walk to many Albany area attractions downtown.  A bit noisy, but very central."
3820211,260993608,2018-05-05,9950291,Jane,The apartment was clean and well-appointed.  The location was near many restaurants and points of interest.  One problem was a very noisy party until 2:00 AM in the bar next door.  The second night was much better.  Overall a pleasant place to stay.
3820211,263318827,2018-05-11,188578934,Sheryll,I love that its in the exact location I needed. Restaurants and Bars  are few steps away . In a college Belt area which I love. Safe walk even at night. Park is walking distance which is great. Wifi is very strong. I love how the place was nice and neat. Will definitely recommend to family and friends. Thanks Terra for the awesome accommodations.
3820211,266759836,2018-05-20,60381957,Annie,Very nice place with easy access. 
3820211,268027164,2018-05-23,29234991,Ash,"Terra is the most accommodating host! When I realized my significant other and I needed to go to Albany, I knew we needed to stay at one of Terra's places! My sister and I had the best Airbnb experience last year at another spot of Terra's.<br/>We booked this one last minute. Terra suggested a few spots for food and study which was great. She also was so flexible and let us check out quite late the next day as we were nervous prepping for a very important interview. It was such a perfect home base right in the middle of so much action. Looking forward to next time! Thanks again!!"
3820211,268966450,2018-05-26,15931660,Claire,"Terra's space was great for our 2 night stay. Our late night arrival did not impact our check-in as she had a self check-in set. As warned, the bar next door was an expected additional noise (and some additional smells...), but she provided a noise machine that I liked so much I kind of want one of my own. I did a load of laundry at her place, which was a nice option as we had multiple destinations on this trip. We finally did discover some washcloths in her dryer, as we were looking for those on our first night. Location was great, local places to grab breakfast, etc. We felt safe and comfortable throughout our stay. Very cool building and clean space!"
3820211,270122209,2018-05-28,48908886,Polina,"My boyfriend and I had a great time here. Everything is walking distance and having a parking spot was definitely a huge plus! The place is extremely clean and we were very happily surprised to see that the bed was bigger than pictured! Overall we had a really great time! Only thing, which I know multiple people mentioned, is the noise. The bar is right outside the bedroom window, so we couldn’t fall asleep until the bar died down."
3820211,271507492,2018-06-01,60638976,Anna,"Great place! Central, active neighborhood. Great food right out the door. We were not bothered by noise at all, there’s just a nice city hum that’s to be expected in this neighborhood."
3820211,272431536,2018-06-03,14682232,Nakina,"The location is fantastic for going out for dinner and drinks. The included parking is a huge plus. The apartment is perfect for a couple looking to enjoy Albany. It was comfortable, clean, relaxing and super cute. We had a great stay and if I am back in Albany again I would stay.  I just really loved this place.  Terra was quick to reply and accommodating.  There was some street noise but it was almost negligible in the bedroom with the door closed and the little sound machine on the night stand. Close walking distance to basically everything you need!  "
3820211,275288606,2018-06-10,185362497,Liz,"What a great apartment!  Clean,  historic, and walking distance to everything you need on a trip.  Right on the local drag with lots of great restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops.  We went to get breakfast one morning and found an art fair right next to the apartment.  The location allowed to enjoy Albany in a way we never have before.  I do not live in a city, so the street noise was a surprise, but it is no different than you would find at any urban location."
3820211,280130301,2018-06-22,181924961,Johannes,"Wir waren nur auf der Durchreise und hatten bei Terra zum Schlafen Halt gemacht. Check-in und die gesamte Organisation waren super. Wie von Terra beschrieben, ist die Wohnung aufgrund der Bars in der Umgebung eher nichts für geräuschempfindliche Gäste. Pluspunkt: Parkplatz direkt an der Wohnung verfügbar."
3820211,281185037,2018-06-24,37575264,Brodi,Great place to stay!

3820211,283355332,2018-06-29,184302980,Tara,This is my favorite building to stay in when visiting Albany.  The parking spot is so helpful.  The location can't be beat.  And the apartment is clean and comfortable.

3820211,288765282,2018-07-10,82209128,Ashley,"Home away in the heart of Albany. Grab dinner at Savoy around the corner or coffee at Dunkin in the a.m., you're near it all."
3820211,291161892,2018-07-15,96652744,Linda,"We really enjoyed staying at Terra’s place. The location was great in a cool part of the city.  The restaurant she recommended was about a 5 minute walk and was incredible.  The unit is bright and clean.   Finally, her communication before and during our stay was always great.  <br/>We would absolutely stay here again when we are in Albany again!"
3820211,293633912,2018-07-20,97831186,Brandon,"Perfect location.   Noise was not an issue for me.  Would love to have some more expected supplies: iron/board, coffee pods for special machine and better kitchen supplies.  "

3820211,297913580,2018-07-28,74177,Richard,Great location. Lots of places to eat and drink in walking distance as well as the capitol plaza and Washington Park. Easy entrance to the building (which is very interesting archtitecturally) and the apartment is spacious and well-appointed.

3820211,306330159,2018-08-12,11375563,Megan,Place was perfect for a quick stay. Bed was a little hard but might be fine for someone else!
3820211,309690938,2018-08-18,17737654,Rick,"Apartment exactly as described. Clean. Super comfy bed and nicely air conditioned. Only concern was that smoke detectors had been taken down throughout the apartment. We found one in a kitchen drawer with a working battery and we put that in the bedroom. These are a must have for me. Otherwise, super easy and convenient. Thank you "
3820211,321129380,2018-09-09,84157223,Bri,"Terra's property was clean, comfortable, and stocked with essentials. It's in a great location for exploring the city on foot. Communication with the hosts was easy, as was check-in/out. A great value overall."

3820211,335996428,2018-10-13,46866738,Nicholas,"Very cute and cozy apartment in the heart of Albany. Very clean. Great response time from host. Very easy check in and very convenient parking onsite.<br/>The best part was probably location. Close to all types of shops and restaurants. <br/>My wife and I enjoyed walking the streets, checking out the stores and enjoying the local eats (& drinks/coffee). Great recommendations from the host.<br/>The only negative is that the walls are thin so we could hear the neighbors upstairs enjoying their Friday night pre gaming before heading out. But nothing that would stop me from staying there again. <br/>I would highly recommend this spot! great price for amazing location."

3820211,351359754,2018-11-22,187697111,Brian,Terra and Matt are first class hosts with a prime value apt in Center Square. You can’t go wrong selecting this spot!
3820211,352764544,2018-11-25,203807923,William,Very nice and comfortable space. Many restaurants within easy walking distance. Good location.
3820211,355008460,2018-12-02,26917192,Eric,"Terra's apartment is in an excellent location. It is very stylish and I enjoyed my stay very much. The internet is fast, the apartment is cosy, the bed is comfortable, and it's conveniently located near many restaurants, and bars. As stated in other reviews there is a bar patio out behind the bedroom window (High fence in between), however I was there on a Friday & Saturday night and the noise was NOT at all a problem for me. I could barely hear the party outside. Communication with host Terra & Matt were great. I would definitely recommend to a single or couple looking for a sweet spot to stay in Albany."
3820211,364881449,2018-12-31,177580301,Rick,"Great location, with off-street parking.  Full size kitchen, with en suite washer and dryer is a tremendous benefit."
3820211,365758732,2019-01-01,213989943,Eleanna,It’s a really nice place in a good location. Food can be easily delivered and there are a lot of places nearby if you need anything. I loved the inside too and it was perfect for 2 people 👍🏼
3820211,405791967,2019-01-27,205380409,Heather,Very walkable location.. For restaurants I would highly recommend Chris's Southern Connection which is just across the intersection.
3820211,408814649,2019-02-05,19512172,Roberto,"Terra, consistently offers excellent service/accommodations."
3820211,413565503,2019-02-17,95471697,Bryant,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Terra's place. Location was on point, I felt safe and have no complaints."

3820211,422995035,2019-03-12,206530978,Hanna,"A neat, safe apartment in central Albany. Would happily stay again"
3820211,423211760,2019-03-13,76652144,Donna,Terra's apartment is clean and stylish in a very cool rehabbed historic building. It is close to Empire State Plaza.
3820211,424295841,2019-03-16,112008588,Xavier,Very cozy home ! Always felt safe and very comfortable! Had an amazing stay ! Terra was extremely helpful and quick to help !
3820211,425130500,2019-03-17,68923830,Justin,The place was located in a perfect spot close to any kinda food you want . Very clean unit loved everything about it ! Would definitely stay here again next time i come up !!!!!
3820211,426583077,2019-03-21,41109480,Sarah,"Listing was just as described. Check-in and access to the building were easy. Host communicated everything the day of check-in. Had all your basic amenities and was perfect for a night stay! It’s right on a main road & close to quite a few bars, which are open LATE, so it can get noisy. Also the building has pretty thin walls. Could hear neighbors laughter & music until pretty late into the night. There must be some sort of shared vent system (old building) because the whole bedroom smelled pretty herby/skunky when we got back from our concert. It wasn’t an issue for us, but I know some people are sensitive or take issue with that type of activity. Great location. Really close to late night pizza, cafes, and plenty of bars and restaurants. Washington park is super close by which is nice to walk through. Empire plaza is within walking distance. All in all it was definitely an acceptable stay for us!"
3820211,435506245,2019-04-10,35010900,Andrew,"Nice place, close to lots of local food + Palace Theater + Times Union + The Egg."
3820211,446046070,2019-04-30,69274318,Manny,Thank you Terra! Lovely stay as always!
3820211,447976386,2019-05-04,85002571,Cynthia,Great location. As stated a little noisy but nothing crazy. It is in a very cool neighborhood with lots of restaurants and pubs to walk to. Short walk to the Egg. Parking was a plus! Will definitely stay here again!
3820211,451290009,2019-05-11,113856633,Lauren,Very nice place ! Close to lots of things. Won’t be bored !

3820211,456841256,2019-05-22,23966291,Laura,Great place!
3820211,457685362,2019-05-24,17724386,Amy,"Unfortunately, my experience did not match the positive reviews others have left. First, the apartment seemed uncleaned, there was a half empty water bottle in the fridge, trash in the bathroom trashcan, and the pillowcases in the bedroom smelled like someone else's boy odor. Rather disappointing, and gross. What was worse was that Terra's instructions said there would be keys on the counter (to use as a back up in case the keypad entry fails, which she said does happen), but there were no keys when we arrived. I reached out to let Terra know and she messaged me saying that someone would drop some off for us...but no one ever did. It was stressful not knowing when/if she was going to come by or if the keypad would fail while we stayed there. Very unprofessional behavior for a host. Also, and this isn't a big deal, but the photos don't accurately reflect the apartment. It's perfectly fine to stay but it's much more run down in person."
3820211,462921206,2019-06-02,50892082,Heather,"Very nice, super clean apartment located perfectly for any Albany visit. <br/>As other people have commented, there is a lot of bar/street noise at night but nothing outrageous. Very quiet in the morning, as a plus."
3820211,507541102,2019-08-11,115267439,Mitul,An absolutely lovely apartment in the prime location of the city!! Would definitely book again!
3820211,509485535,2019-08-14,56203821,Derrick,A great place. Super clean and a solid location. Host was able to answer a question and help us out at midnight so we were very thankful. Highly recommend.
3820211,512546928,2019-08-18,147115397,Alison,"Great place, very spacious, clean and has nice amenities. The parking space is a huge plus! Would definitely stay again."
3820211,526124449,2019-09-08,105585617,Adrienne,Super clean and tidy apartment with a spacious kitchen and bathroom! Nice location close to restaurants and cafes on Lark Street and a large grocery store a few minutes' walk away. Very handy to have free parking on premises as well. Great place!
3820211,526912300,2019-09-09,34854216,Michele,Terra’s place was perfect. My husband and I were in Albany for only 24 hrs so the prime location and easy parking allowed us to make the most of our time. Check-in was a breeze with keypad entry. The apartment was very lovely with high ceilings and tasteful decorations. Importantly the bed was extremely comfortable! Definitely would stay here again.
3820211,530191645,2019-09-15,25282129,Carlo,Such a unique and comfortable place to stay! Really enjoyed the central location of the place and loved the overall experience. Definitely recommend the place!
3820211,534294787,2019-09-22,40427970,Renee,We rented Terra's place for a quick overnight stay as we were in town for a show at the Times Union Center. Her instructions were thorough just prior to our check in time. She was responsive when I had a quick question. The location was close enough to walk to several restaurants and to the concert venue. The apartment itself was pretty basic but worked for us for a quick trip to Albany!
3820211,538184626,2019-09-29,9584389,Chelsea,"Good host, easy to communicate with. The apartment is spacious and in a great location. Off-street parking is a major bonus."
3820211,540441855,2019-10-03,39957503,Jerry,"Hi Terra, Thanks for hosting your place.  This was my 2nd stay in this building.  Each unit has met my needs, but Unit #4 was especially nice since it's along the back-side and quieter than the street facing units.  Hope to stay again when I'm back in Albany."
3820211,545549563,2019-10-12,45594369,Lauren,Super cute place! Clean and comfortable. The experience was easy and stress free. I would definitely recommend!
3820211,547093799,2019-10-14,4149802,Lindsey,"Uber convenient location — found a great yoga studio up the road, lots of restaurant and bar options, and a full grocery store around the corner. It’s also walking distance to a couple large green spaces to enjoy the sunshine. <br/>Staying on a Sunday night there wasn’t much noise disturbance. A simple and well furnished space with easy self access fit the needs of a quick stopover on my travels."
3820211,548450777,2019-10-17,107160788,Nancy,"The images posted don’t lie! It is a comfortable and nicely decorated place. The furniture is comfortable, loved the sheets, and the kitchen is well stocked."
3820211,551720004,2019-10-20,69006851,Lindsay,"Perfect location for those looking to enjoy Lark St. Immaculate, modern, and cozy. We’ll definitely be back!"

3820211,565646512,2019-11-17,16858376,Gary,"Location was great, check in was a breeze, apartment was just as advertised. Will look to  stay again on our next visit."
3820211,567058302,2019-11-21,9990176,Sadie,We were in Albany for a quick work meeting and loved the space! It’s a cool building that is well located. We walked to a great dinner recommended to us by Terra. Everything was easy to use and we had a great nights sleep in there.
3820211,627823943,2020-06-05,30736777,Kayla,"My stay with Terra, was fantastic. I had to stay in NY for about 7/8 weeks (possibly more), and she made that time much easier. I had to book per week not know what my work schedule would include and she accommodated every need. Quick response. Wonderful amenities. Beautiful space. Attentive host. Fantastic location. It’s very rare to find that “unicorn” Airbnb, but it’s been found! Highly recommend, and I will absolutely be staying in one of her properties again. Thanks again, Terra!"
3820211,629907806,2020-06-15,9505527,Thyme & Barbie,"Oh my gosh!  Not only was the place super beautiful, unique and a pleasure to stay at it was also a very central location. I would recommend this Airbnb to anybody who’s in Albany and wants to be in a central location that’s really great to get around + on-site parking!! It was spacious and I loved every second. Terra was also accommodating in letting me check-in early which I wildly appreciate. Stay here-it’s awesome."
3820211,719780966,2020-12-30,4421776,John,"Fantastic, modern, lofty apartment in the middle of everything - with parking! Plus Terra is super-responsive. Wonderful stay, highly recommend!"
3820211,720884198,2021-01-02,75026433,Carly,Great space! Peaceful/quiet few days in Albany. Amenities were excellent. Highly recommend.
3820211,739092301,2021-03-14,337106377,Aidan,"Terra is an incredible host. The organization i work for is always booking with her locations, and we are blown away everytime. Extremely accomodating, helpful, and ensures we have all we need. Thank you so much, Terra!"
3820211,742706086,2021-03-27,22823057,Caitlin,"We had a great stay at Terras place. We come to Albany at least once a year and this spot was one of the best we’ve stayed at. The on-site parking was a definite plus and the host was very responsive (she even dropped off batteries within 5 minutes of us asking if there were any in the apartment). The location is great - walking distance to restaurants, a grocery store, and the park and a short drive to the highway. Would recommend Terra’s place and we hope to stay here again!"
3820211,743136804,2021-03-28,194068355,Kallie,Super spacious place & can't beat the location! I would stay here again--loved having parking on-site.
3820211,647020060829837199,2022-06-11,45291694,Jen And Andy,"Ok place, the host is not responsive at all.  Read the other reviews left by guest; they are pretty accurate.  We should have red them first."
3820211,701428636537917628,2022-08-25,17911688,Alena,"Unfortunately, we had an unsatisfactory stay at Terra’s place and had to end our stay early.<br/>Shortly before check-in, Terra texted us to let us know that the microwave was out for repairs and would be reinstalled in a day or two. Not a big deal—these things happen, glad to know it was being attended to.<br/>Upon arrival, we found the unit door had been left wide open—presumably by the cleaner, according to our host, still texting as of our arrival—which didn’t start things off with a great sense of security. A few more texts about the parking situation (airbnb listing needs to be updated) and getting the A/C to work (more on that later).<br/>That would be the last we heard from our host until we left 4 days later. All our concerns were left unresolved.<br/>We found the place in ok condition—some wear and tear throughout, decently appointed, good light,  reliable internet, *generally* clean. Comfy bed! But trash under that bed, more than a few random chunks of glass in the carpet, and sticky cabinet handles in the kitchen.<br/>Went to use the TV to find that there was no cable box—just a coaxial cable hanging some distance away from the tv—and thus no cable.<br/>The controls for the A/C are outside the unit in the common hallway for the apartment building, and are apparently used by and for multiple units—other people would come by and adjust the settings at all hours of day and night, putting us in an erratic and stressful back-and-forth war with other unknown parties over our unit’s never-settled temperature.<br/>The microwave never came, though we wondered for a few days if someone was just going to barge in unannounced to install an appliance in the middle of our work day.<br/>After 4 days of radio silence from our host, we contacted AirBNB for a refund and left. No idea what happened, but not a good time."
3820211,708720990372796020,2022-09-04,89582269,Stephen,"We we unable to get into the Airbnb with the provided code, took over 30 minutes and a call to Airbnb to get a response from host. We ended up finding another place to stay due to time constraints for our quick trip through Albany."

3820211,850786935512923671,2023-03-19,9502028,Santi / Bogdan,"This was a good place, we had some missing amenities which the host resolved on the next day. Highly recommended for the central location and clean space."

The location was super convenient for all of our travel destinations and we were able to have calm Memorial Day Weekend in the State Capital!<br/>Thank You Terra for everything! 💓"

3820211,1020387548889868908,2023-11-08,177595497,Joey,"Horrible stay. Avoid, avoid.<br/>Host is not communicative, and simply forgot to send us check in instructions at the beginning of our stay. Phone voice mailbox is full, and took two hours past check in time to actually get a hold of her and get instructions to get in.<br/>Place itself is just fine. Cheap poor-quality furniture in the process of falling apart and missing basic amenities like spoons or kitchen scissors? Bathroom shower was moldy when we got into the unit and needed to be replaced.<br/>Worst of all though, the neighbors were given the code and entered our place on more than one occasion to change the thermostat (which supposedly controls their units too). We now suspect they entered at several points while were asleep or away on day trips. This made us feel very unsafe, and the host was so clueless about it she offered to change the door code *after our check out*, as if she shouldn't be doing that every time. <br/>Stay away, thank me later."
3820211,1028313191281587417,2023-11-19,398439461,Douglas,Nice place and location

It was very clean especially the bathroom. If you like cooking for yourself, there is a great kitchen setup. <br/>The neighbor was pretty nice. There is a pizza shop across the street, a Dunkin’ Doughnuts, as well as gas station. At no point did we feel unsafe. <br/>We would be happy to book with them again when we come back to Albany."
3820211,1101567425797600205,2024-02-28,460016794,Elizabeth,"The accomodation was a Fantastic surprise, it’s a restored historical precinct so there was a lot of space & comfort. Conveniently located, a 10 min walk from The NY Museum & The Egg, it’s also close to the bus stop & cafes. The Welcome basket was a delight & the amenities came in handy. It was a fun experience."

3820211,1130454481692595613,2024-04-08,351235528,Aniah,Overall my stay was good. I do have a toddler that loves to explore and unfortunately the handle for the door to the hallway was within her reach which resulted in her being able to run out. The handle doesn’t lock on the inside so a deadbolt would’ve been great! Perfect for a couple or a single person for sure!
3820211,1136238831257764952,2024-04-16,98473764,Ron,Terra’s airbnb was amazing; very large open space and super clean.  Great location and walkable to the egg and the MVP arena.

3820211,1213134018375295900,2024-07-31,348961333,Benjamin,Booked the stay while for the bar exam.  Space was very clean and comfortable. Easily walking access to the rest of the city. The little welcome basket upon arrival made my day!
5651579,31644484,2015-05-08,30058843,Mafruha,"In general, it seems Gregg is good person.
<br/>
<br/>I found the place  is not healthy to live. It is an extension of a basement, or a basement, no daylight, no ventilation; and heater does not work of run even in the cold. It is dark without light and the roof is very low.  Also there is not real bed . I was lucky to have a garage with this rent.
<br/>One should ask questions about this place before renting the place. 
<br/>"
5651579,32181587,2015-05-15,13895419,Zachary,"Great Airbnb. The apartment was well kept and right next to the Empire State Plaza, and Gregg was friendly and responsive. Would recommend."
5651579,40426995,2015-07-31,29867713,Lauren,Gregg's basement apartment was clean and quaint.  It is in a convenient location to the Empire State Plaza for any future bar takers.

While it is located in a basement, there isn't much light that goes in, but as a place to sleep it's quite convenient. I would recommend any bar taker to stay here as it is only a short walk to the Empire Plaza. 
<br/>Gregg was very professional, responding promptly to all of my questions. I also really appreciated that he let me leave my bags in there during the exam so that I could get them back easily afterwards. "
5651579,65109702,2016-03-10,61720685,Candice,Gregg's place is close to the center of Albany and perfect for business travel. It's private and spacious.
5651579,66132914,2016-03-19,23679728,Brittany,I staycationed here. This place is fantastic - It is large and private. Greg was super accessible via text. The location is awesome - doors down from one of my favorite coffee shops! There is also a backyard accessible from the apartment.
5651579,66738199,2016-03-24,60061490,Emily,"Gregg was very accommodating!  After reaching out to him to let him ask about check-in and check-out times, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that both of these were flexible.  When we arrived to the apartment, he checked in to make sure we had found everything okay, and had even provided insight for parking in the busy city of Albany!  The pictures accurately depict the studio flat, and the bed was very comfortable.  For conferences or functions at the New York State Museum, Empire Convention Center, or the State House, this location is AWESOME.  Thanks, Gregg!!"
5651579,68667117,2016-04-06,1287848,Chad,"Awesome place just steps from the egg!  Very central and close to pubs, stores and fast food.  And the host is exceptional!  Thanks again for a great stay!"
5651579,70331931,2016-04-17,66835676,Andrew,Gregg was available for my questions even late at night and had everything all set for me. Parking in the garage was such a bonus. So close to the egg! If I come back to Albany I would love to stay again. Thanks!
5651579,72313455,2016-05-01,7277779,Michael,Gregg was accomodating and made sure we were able to enter our apartment upon arrival. The location is hard to beat. Its directly down the street from the plaza and set amongst an entire neighborhood of beautiful row houses.
5651579,89524674,2016-07-28,40209567,Junpei,"[Japanese follows] Gregg's place is the best AirBnB for the NY bar takers. If your exam place is Empire State Plaza, this palce is located within 10 minutes walk distance. You can easily come back and have lunch at this place during lunch break (1.5 hour). In the room, there is nice reading desk and a desk lamp so you can do final check for the bar.

<br/>ニューヨーク州の司法試験を受験する際に利用しました。アルバニーにとって一大イベントであるため近隣のホテルはこの期間は一泊２００ドルから３００ドルとかなり高い設定になってしまいます。もしリーズナブルな価格で、かつ、会場に近いところで宿泊先を探されている方がいらっしゃいましたらこちらの会場をオススメします。会場まで歩いて５〜１０分ほどです。静かで十分なスペース、キッチン、バス、シャワーはもちろんのこと、しっかりした勉強机と卓上スタンドライトも用意してくれていましたので、最後の追い込み勉強にも十分な環境です。少々建物が古く、また、半地下なため少し暗い印象を受けましたが、それ以外は十分満足できる環境です。ホストのグレッグとはメールでのやりとりのみでしたがこちらの問い合わせやリクエストにもクイックかつ柔軟に対応してくれるのでありがたかったです。"
5651579,92078985,2016-08-07,85306535,Andrew,"We really enjoyed the location, the large room and bathroom, and access to a patio in back. The host is an excellent helper too :)"
5651579,93237415,2016-08-12,37401878,Arielle,"Really loved Gregg's speedy replies, and the ease with which we got in and out of the apartment.  Highly recommend, this was one of the best Airbnb's I've had. "
5651579,97217318,2016-08-26,3547037,Steven, Good value for money
5651579,99641898,2016-09-05,46884766,Jellisa,Greg was awesome! Getting into the apartment was a breeze and he responded almost immediately to any questions I had. Really enjoyed my stay.
5651579,101669194,2016-09-14,37886141,Matt,"The place was great; exactly as advertised. I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Gregg, but he was accommodating with a special request and had everything in order for an easy and comfortable stay. I highly recommend the Gregg and the room. "
5651579,102891638,2016-09-19,36893068,Brian,Cozy apartment. Thank you 
5651579,103630835,2016-09-23,88593709,Hannah,"Gregg gave very accurate information prior to my arrival, which made it easy to access the place, even when I arrived late at night by myself. When I had to call him at one point, he answered right away. "
5651579,105446442,2016-10-01,7054368,Melissa,"Unfortunately I had an awful experience with this rental. I arrived very late at night and had trouble opening up the lock box.  I was very confused as to where to enter the home as I had received no information from Gregg ahead of time regarding what entrance to use or what level the studio was on.  I was worried that I was going to open a door to find someone else in the room. The keys that I received out of the lock box didn't open the room that I had expected. When I entered into the basement hallway, it was super creepy. There was paperwork and trash all over these two random desks in the hallway, it didn't feel clean or safe at all.  I saw a small notebook piece of paper taped to one door that said ""suite"" on it so I tried my key and it didn't work. So I tried the key on the other door in the hallway and it opened it. It was a creepy room with all red carpeting and a single bed in it without a bathroom and there were doors leading to another room that were only blocked by chairs. I felt so unsafe.  It was late at night and this building and the rooms did not seem secure to me. I chose to leave for the night versus stay in this awful, creepy accommodation which should speak in volumes considering how late at night it was.  "
5651579,106166672,2016-10-04,48110773,Brandon,"To be honest, of all the things that stood out to me with this apartment is that Gregg's communication was simply incredible. Each time I had a question I got a response within 10 minutes, always with a warm and welcoming tone and extremely helpful. The location was pretty much as close to the NY state capital as you can get and things were spacious."
5651579,106499450,2016-10-06,88968383,Shaz,Gregg was great.  easy to contact with questions and happy to be of help.
5651579,107431263,2016-10-10,93188935,Nicolas,Great stay. Everything was as descibed. Parking and convenient location. Highly recommended.
5651579,108109490,2016-10-14,36337615,Brendan,Gregg's place is a great spot to explore Albany and the surrounding region from.  Very safe and comfortable and a stone's throw from the Empire Plaza/State Capital and a short walk to Lark Street and other bars/cafés/restaurants.  Ample street parking as well.  Would recommend to anyone needing a convenient place on a budget in the Capital Region<br/>Restaurant recommendations in Albany: Bombers Burritos and Sukhothai.
5651579,108705731,2016-10-17,33440835,Lynn,"Host was responsive to email. Neighborhood is urban. Good location for exploring the capital, downtown Albany and Lark Street by foot. Property maintenance a bit uneven."
5651579,108822983,2016-10-17,2334011,E.,"Location is pretty good, his communication for the most part is pretty fast and informative too. Great location as described. 
<br/>There is a VERY lived in workspace when you come through the lower studio but he was not there during my stay. Which would be off-putting because whenever you come straight out of the studio the open workspace is right there between you (the lower studio) and the door.
<br/>
<br/>The actual suite inside of the lower studio looked clean inside but there was like an ""old"" stuffy smell throughout when I came in. I had to Febreeze a lot and some of the smell still didn't quite go away.  Didn't smell dirty at all....just a bit weird at first. Kindo of vintage like old leather books. Maybe because of the age of the building itself? 
<br/>It got kind of cold to me inside as it started to get into the early evening. The heat of the building was set to 70 which is way too low imo to be a comfortable heat setting even with it being 66 outside at the time that didn't change inside it felt like it was freezing. It was extra uncomfortable when you hop straight out of the shower.  
<br/>
<br/>All the amenities in it were great except for you have no control at all over the temperature. Kind of at the whim of the owner. 
<br/>I'd consider staying again ... if there's a full studio suite in the upper part of the building too. Whoever was above me at the time of my stay were not light walkers or quiet at all (from like 6:30pm to 10:30).
<br/>
<br/>Repeat? Depends but leaning to yes ... maybe get a NEST thing or add in a way that guests who rent a full studio apartment can have control of the temperature in the studio...otherwise it gives the feel of like a big private room with a kitchen in a house and not a regular studio apartment. The temperature thing was a minor drawback but still really liked the place esp for location and price.  Or in colder weather at least provide a space heater."
5651579,109428068,2016-10-21,59587489,Rob,"I didn't look much at the photos or anything I just needed a spot close spot to stay quick and Gregg provided just that. Quick trip went well, without any issues. "
5651579,109951712,2016-10-23,28116107,Clay,"The red door in the picture is the upstairs, the AirBnB is under the stairs, the entrance is next to the garbage cans. Although not a bad place to stay, it needs some work. We were disappointed enough to get a hotel rather than stay the night :/"
5651579,110621529,2016-10-27,47502770,Joshua,"Really cute little flat. Nice size, comfy bed and all around good stay. A super short drive off of the freeway and to the heart of Albany. You cannot beat it for the price!"
5651579,111235712,2016-10-30,3387598,Meredith,"Greg made us feel very welcome and everything was very easy to navigate, it was a good option for us since the wedding reception was less than a ten minute walk away. "

5651579,133951849,2017-02-25,71644820,James,"A nice little place within easy walking distance of the State Archives and Library.  This is good option for any scholars looking to conduct research, much cheaper than the hotels in the area!  The kitchen had all the basics for cooking, and the bathroom and shower were quite nice.  A comfy bed and ample furniture for sitting on.  The host left a toothbrush, towels, and even some tea bags which were all a thoughtful touch.<br/>Overall I had an excellent stay."

5651579,135000325,2017-03-02,473399,Drew,"I used this for a work trip at the Capitol, and it's very convenient for that: it's only 1 1/2 blocks from the entrance to the Empire State Plaza concourse (so close, in fact, I didn't even take my coat with me in winter). In addition to food & drink options in the Concourse, there is a good bar, a bar/restaurant, and a coffeehouse <1 block away.<br/>The host left good, easy instructions for entry and was communicative and flexible about my schedule.<br/>The room/suite is large and clean, though simple and basic (kitchen, TV). Although basement-level from the front, there are full-size, above-ground windows in the back. Hallway bathroom shared with other room. "

The house is also close to public transportation, 10 mins to Greyhound station and 30 mins to Amtrak station. Gregg is also a very nice person and he has helped us got through the storm in Albany, offering us advice on how to check the status for the train and bus and letting us stay in his place for extra hours to wait for the train. Enjoy your stay!  : ) "
5651579,139274681,2017-03-24,112441630,Will,Gregg was incredibly easy to work with and very responsive to questions. The studio was spotless and I had everything I needed for the night.

My husband and I stayed overnight after a concert at The Egg and it couldn't have worked out better. We were able stroll to an amazing Mexican/Spanish restaurant (El Mariachi) and had amazing food before wandering over to the concert hall. Gregg was communicative and helpful the whole time, staying in touch and making sure we had everything we needed. It was more than worth the money spent and we would stay there again in a heartbeat.

5651579,161776110,2017-06-18,32224758,Daniel,Gregg was very nice. He let me use his garage because I was moving and had a car load of stuff. 
5651579,162870920,2017-06-22,71822506,Samantha,The host is great! The layout is a little quirky with the bathroom being outside of the bedroom area.
5651579,164259116,2017-06-26,124475900,Devyn,"The best part of this studio is the proximity to the Egg and the Plaza, and the bus station. I was able to walk everywhere I needed to go while visiting Albany. It was also a great price for the location. "

5651579,171747315,2017-07-18,134127685,Brent,Had a great stay at Gregg's place and everything was as told. Kind of like having your own apartment for the room I stayed in.
5651579,172688135,2017-07-21,35240365,Maria,"The studio is nice and centrally located.  It was nice for a short We did not meet Gregg, but he made it easy to get the keys when we arrived.  Overall, we had a very nice stay; the only disadvantage is that the main bathroom is a bit far from the syudio making it inconvenient. "
5651579,174841794,2017-07-27,52257261,Helen,"The location of the studio is 5 minutes walk to the Egg which was perfect for my stay.<br/>I needed a private space and this was as private as it gets as the studio was at the back of the house on the ground floor. <br/>I stayed here for 5 nights- check-in was self explanatory and the host Gregg was very amenable and communicative. He popped in in person to say hello which was very nice of him. He was very quick to come by when there was a problem with the studio as well. <br/>The amenities are quite basic with the kitchen and the sleeping area joined together. The bathroom is just outside the studio, but that was never an issue as I never bumped into other people. <br/>Just to note: there is a lack of sunlight due to this being kinda half on the lower ground floor. <br/>But the price and the location can't be beat. Thank you for your hospitality Gregg! "
5651579,175331651,2017-07-28,141221993,Calvin,The apartment is smaller than was let on there's a shared bathroom which is a bit weird if you actually end up having to share it with someone you don't know and it's all very very old the baseboards are a bit gross to look at and the mouse traps left out weren't very nice either all in all probably wouldn't stay here again although Gregg is a nice enough guy
5651579,176736193,2017-07-31,49227169,Brian,Gregg is an excellent host & was always available to answer questions if need be. This spacious studio is in a terrific location to downtown with all amenities for business travelers such as Wi-Fi access.  It's located on a quiet street/neighborhood with easy street parking if one has a car. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
5651579,181411318,2017-08-12,114253921,Grace,"Gregg always answered our questions. You do have to share a bathroom. That being said, the shower and toilet were not the cleanest. Our room was big, nice, and clean. Overall a good place to stay if you're looking for a good deal price wise..."
5651579,182465801,2017-08-14,42842521,Elizabeth,"This is a great place to stop for a bit in Albany. Close to the little shopping area on Madison Ave. I was a little startled to see the bathroom was outside the studio, but I probably just didn't read the other reviews closely enough to realize that ahead of time. It was a little dusty but the bed linens appeared to be clean and freshly laundered."
5651579,183561692,2017-08-17,24152378,Max,"Good location close to downtown and the capitol. Good communication, checked in to see if I needed anything."
5651579,186810161,2017-08-25,78361973,Eugene,"Spacious and clean. Free parking was available both nights to 9AM.  One light didn't work, and the lock box needs a good hard push to close it , but the setting across the Cathedral, loved the bells, and the park was just what an intown location should be."
5651579,187795800,2017-08-27,63910221,Jason,Gregg's Place was awesome and great location. I would Definetely stay here again.
5651579,188246701,2017-08-28,126309736,Adam,Gregg let us park the car in the garage which felt very safe. The building was quiet at night. Surrounding area seemed a little rough but we never felt unsafe. Within walking distance to everything worth seeing in Albany!
5651579,190241904,2017-09-03,16354950,Liz,Enjoyed my stay at Gregg's place.  It was cute and homely. I really liked that it was close to downtown.
5651579,212989336,2017-11-19,3838074,Alessandra,Gregg was wonderful and the place was perfect. I would highly recommend. Thank you Gregg!
5651579,213675764,2017-11-22,121134777,Annmarie,Great price for a comfortable place. Amazing location. Right on a bus line to the train station. Gregg is wonderful. The place was Private and quiet.
5651579,215272536,2017-11-28,157657255,Jc,"Gregg himself seems like a very nice guy. We didn’t see each other in person but he made himself available when I needed assistance. The space overall is pretty accurate to the description. It’s definitely studio size but not uncomfortably crowded by any means. The bathroom is not in the actual space but it’s literally down the hall. It can be a little confusing at first with the whole blueprint of where the space itself is actually located within the building but Gregg is there to help. There are some other tenants in the building but I didn’t have any issues from them. Cleanliness was a bit of an issue but only for certain things. Overall, this wouldn’t be a bad place to spend the night when in Albany."
5651579,217080947,2017-12-07,155582703,Kenneth,Can't beat the location in this great old building. Minutes fro the State Museum and downtown. Quaint. Convenient. And I will definitely stay again.
5651579,218401180,2017-12-12,154118747,Syeda,I stayed at Greg's place for an Albany interview. I thought the place was conveniently located and it was very comfortable and warm.
5651579,218580423,2017-12-13,12711324,Katherine,Gregg was an excellent host. I forgot my wallet at the apartment and he helped me get it back. Literally saved my life!
5651579,218893839,2017-12-15,156389730,Beau,Gregg has an awesome place to stay in! He was very responsive to all of my questions and requests. Would highly recommend
5651579,219905835,2017-12-19,157245604,Lorie,Gregg us everything you could possibly hope for in a Host!
5651579,221417976,2017-12-26,160065925,Samantha,It was perfect location to my son!! I had a great time and enjoyed<br/> a white Christmas in 2017
5651579,221743330,2017-12-27,8774275,Tyler,Gregg’s studio is in the garden level of a row house right next to Empire State Plaza. It served me well for a one-night stay in Albany.
5651579,222005239,2017-12-28,163052165,Jeff,Gregg’s space is great. So close to TU Cener and other downtown spots. Available at all hours. Clean space. Can’t beat it. Book it while you can!!
5651579,222751421,2017-12-30,36784831,Maggie,"Great, old city space with cozy vintage decor!"
5651579,223066909,2017-12-31,86602603,Shari,"The apartment was spacious, clean and cozy with vintage charm! Kitchen was clean with everything you would need. Shared bathroom was clean and just steps away. Had no problems with other guests using the bathroom. In fact, I didn’t see anyone else! Shower had amazing hot water and great water pressure!  Towels, soap, hair dryer was provided in case you didn’t have. TV, WiFi and comfy bed.  Good location. Parking on the street wasn’t a problem. I had no problem using the lockbox. Met Gregg who was a nice friendly guy! Would definitely stay there again."
5651579,225818350,2018-01-07,3142542,Sebastian,"As usual, a great stay. A warm and friendly welcome. Good tips for food/drinks nearby. Nice historic house in downtown Albany with a lot of personal touches, very comfortable bed in which you'll sleep like a stone, TV, coffee, kitchen with fridge and everything. Couple good restaurants a few minutes away, very close to bus terminal and as close as you can get to the Amtrak train station just on the other side of the bridge. Gregg is very responsive to e-mails and phone."
5651579,226262584,2018-01-09,134798754,Jesse,Great value.
5651579,226400977,2018-01-10,111604294,Tyler,The area was close to everything and was easy to get to! Amazing place and Gregg was very helpful

5651579,228199099,2018-01-18,11640173,Ian,Great place. Very close walk to the Empire State Plaza and a few pubs. Gregg was very responsive and made sure I had a parking space in front of the apartment. It was clean and comfortable.
5651579,229008157,2018-01-21,109982697,Jane,"Hezké čisté místo, dobrá lokalita. Vše jsme měli připraveno. Doporučuji."
5651579,229426330,2018-01-23,134798754,Jesse,"Very good location, great value."
5651579,229626258,2018-01-24,3142542,Sebastian,"Once again an outstanding stay, perfectly equipped studio with very comfortable bed. If you're at Greg's place, don't miss to go to the NY State Museum. It's literally one block away, free and full of interesting natural and regional history. And of course walk down the magnificent Empire State Plaza above it."
5651579,229805378,2018-01-25,155582703,Kenneth,"You can't beat the location. Comfortable ""home away from home"". The best value in town!"
5651579,231104624,2018-01-30,9407818,Anthony,Great price and location. Gregg is super accommodating and getting access when I arrived was a breeze. Will for sure do it again. Great for people who have a quick trip to Albany and need to be at Capitol. 
5651579,231510672,2018-02-01,63893820,Jannika,"Gregg Is a wonderful host. I was in the area for an exam, and his place was a nice, quiet place to study and rest."
5651579,231967273,2018-02-03,162676029,Stephen,"Great place in a cool building, convenient location, really clean and comfortable. Gregg’s a great host!"

5651579,233213305,2018-02-08,162676029,Stephen,"Best air bnb for under 50 in all of Alban, with out a doubt."
5651579,234931509,2018-02-14,34614685,Richard,"Greg's studio is great value. It has a quirky, vintage charm and has everything you could need for your stay. The location couldn't be better. Easy walking distance to Empire State Plaza, The Egg etc. and there are cafes and bars close by too. The room itself was spacious, warm and the bed was comfortable. It has a TV and well equipped kitchen (although we didn't use either). The wifi worked well. The shared bathroom and shower were clean and we didn't have any issues with access to them. Gregg was a great host, arranging parking in advance of our stay. He was responsive and came down to introduce himself to us and enquire if we needed anything shortly after we arrived. Overall a great Airbnb experience and excellent value."
5651579,235423905,2018-02-16,789532,Ami,Gregg was terrific! Very responsive and the place was perfect for my stay. Highly recommended!

5651579,239917275,2018-03-03,164937386,Jing,"I was very very lucky to have got Gregg's place during my trip to Albany. It was a whole package of goodness: Clean, Stylish, Spacious, Comfortable, Functional ...... ( I am running out of good words really), and the unbeatable Location!!! <br/>I highly recommend Gregg's place to anyone who is on either personal or business trip to Albany !!"
5651579,240293660,2018-03-04,40489570,Katie,"Great location!! We parked right out front and didn’t have to move the car the whole time. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Great host, made sure we got in and offered valuable information. Great communication. I would stay here again in a heartbeat :-)"
5651579,240871589,2018-03-06,173639519,Cindy,Was a great place to stay if you are spending anytime at the Egg. Was just a quick walk over to it. Thanks Gregg.
5651579,241271691,2018-03-08,46723798,Brooke,This apt is centrally locates with views of a beautiful old church and the egg. Greg communicates in a clear timely fashion and the sheets on the bed were some of the softest I have ever slept on. I was very comfortable and would go again.
5651579,242330315,2018-03-11,175158974,Silvana,Great location for those visiting the capital or attending a conference.
5651579,243919043,2018-03-17,167670439,Tania,"Gregg was very nice, and quick yo respond. We enjoyed the studio, it was very clean and homely."
5651579,244329570,2018-03-18,76954381,Eric,Great place! Exactly what I needed for my short stay there.
5651579,244753093,2018-03-19,98957834,Amanda,"Gregg was a great host.  While I never saw him, he was always quick to respond if I messaged him with any questions.  The only complaints that I have are that the space looks like it could use some updating and it was in a low-income area (I was hesitant to walk there at night).  However, it was well worth the price that I paid.  If I'm in the area again anytime soon, I will definitely consider staying at Gregg's place again."
5651579,249094501,2018-04-01,72294354,Grant,I recommend this place.
5651579,252421960,2018-04-10,64750600,Iris,"Gregg is a fantastic host! He is friendly and helps out whichever way he can. The location of his place was also terrific. If you have to work in the New York State Archives, want to visit the New York State Museum or any thing else downtown Gregg’s studio is the place to be!"
5651579,252888261,2018-04-12,2097174,Wesley,Great value and amazing location to walk to Arena and NY Capital complex. Comfy bed taboot
5651579,253208144,2018-04-13,5813686,Steve,"I very much enjoyed staying here.  The place was cool, and I liked the location, which is downtown within walking distance of many bars/restaurants.  City lovers will especially appreciate this.  Good value for the price.  Big thumbs up."
5651579,253937832,2018-04-15,184165282,Asaya,"Thanks Gregg for a good stay. Nice and easy access and big room. Cool kitchen area and clean bathroom. Also I love the neighborhood! It was a bit cold weather-wise but there were accommodations (parks, bars, corner stores, restaurants) nearby and friendly people. I was happy to find a place in that part of town. Great to stay in a spot in a diverse neighborhood with lots of character and culture."
5651579,255133803,2018-04-19,65761006,Nicolas,"Nice place to stay if you find yourself in Albany, excellent location very close to everything and great value."

5651579,258687716,2018-04-29,103351655,Jackson,"Great studio with back door for fresh air. Didn't realize it was a shared bathroom or a multiple apartment complex, but the stay was good. Would recommend"
5651579,260680424,2018-05-04,187167149,Katy,"If you’re looking for a quick, simple, affordable stay in downtown Albany this is the place!!"

5651579,267415169,2018-05-21,55801740,Jamie,"Our stay with Gregg was quick but comfortable! Very unique and beautiful antique decor throughout this Brownstone. You'll find everything you need here. The bathroom is located down the hall so it's technically not inside the room, but that didn't bother us in the slightest. Overall pleasant stay!"
5651579,268292620,2018-05-24,189788001,Jose,"Great studio, clean, cozy and very well located!"
5651579,270889078,2018-05-30,189827696,Anthony,Exceptionally clean.
5651579,271890541,2018-06-02,30448591,Carrie,I stayed here for a quick trip to Albany. The studio had everything and was great and you can't beat the location. I would definitely stay there again.
5651579,272517394,2018-06-03,37448531,Zoe,Gregg responded very quickly to my last-minute request. The room is quite large!
5651579,273006787,2018-06-04,13372568,B.W.,"Gregg was an excellent communicator and accommodated ALL my extra needs. The kitchen was awesomely stocked and the decor was very cool. This location was walking distance to the Albany Center & Times Union Center, as well as many other central down town attractions, even the Hudson River!"
5651579,273574065,2018-06-06,8381854,Chris,"I really enjoyed my stay at Gregg's place. It was as advertised, conveniently located, and actually cozy in a way that made me just want to hang out inside. I'd definitely stay again. "
5651579,273870691,2018-06-07,193893539,Kojo,This space was very homey and clean. Gregg provided everything we needed and communicated very well. 
5651579,275258549,2018-06-10,192709,Mary,"Gregg’s place is quiet, but super convenient to downtown Albany, and the Capitol. The space is big with a little kitchen, if you want to cook. I enjoyed my coffee each morning.  Recommend staying at Gregg’s if you’re in Albany!"
5651579,276081284,2018-06-12,51533409,Mitch,Great value for the money.  Safe and attractive location a short walk away from downtown Albany’s sights and sounds
5651579,276745437,2018-06-14,195024969,Lori,right across the street from the capitol.
5651579,277107355,2018-06-15,144445841,Mary Ann,Great place on quiet area near capital. Nice kitchen area.   Clean and Gregg communicates.  Would like to stay again.
5651579,278242205,2018-06-17,196033735,Zoraya,Great place. Would recommend this place to friends and family.
5651579,278291888,2018-06-17,115182640,Michael,excellent service. Gregg always answers his phone right away
5651579,280556967,2018-06-23,49453289,David,Nice place.  Had a nice time.
5651579,281345713,2018-06-24,15613231,Edward,"Good location, easy access, gets the job done if you’re just looking for a place to crash in the evenings. "
5651579,282506292,2018-06-27,116022015,Becky,Gregg was great at responding to our questions about parking.  The location is perfect for visiting the capitol and local museums.
5651579,287722454,2018-07-08,64750600,Iris,"Second time staying at Greggs place because I enjoyed it so much the first time. Nice accommodation, great host and excellent location. In fact, this airbnb is ideal if you want to conduct research at the New York State Archives and Library.  Only a 5 minute walk away! "
5651579,289120861,2018-07-11,90700860,Dimitri,Very charming historic building.  Near downtown Albany.  Only a few blocks from several great restaurants.  Gregg is an expert on Albany.  I'd definitely stay here again!
5651579,294916306,2018-07-22,51780699,Carolina,"This is a cool little spot in the basement of a classic architecture house. It has a lot of character. Great location (close to the NYS museum), clear directions, and easy check-in/out process. Shared bathroom. We had a great stay!"
5651579,296354087,2018-07-25,9759926,Angelica,"As advertised, no frills place. Good wifi. Basement apartment, so low light. Walking distance to Albany Capital Center. Gregg was very responsive. Watch out for alternate side parking! No local food options here but walk to the Center for more options. "
5651579,297852500,2018-07-28,187697111,Brian,"Gregg’s studio is on point, a very good location just off the Empire State Plaza."
5651579,299284497,2018-07-30,197390925,Alan,"Nice, clean place."
5651579,304438723,2018-08-09,83180593,Chris,Wonderful place for a great price in a great location!
5651579,304964008,2018-08-10,76204281,Sara,Great location! The place was perfect for my trip. Gregg was very responsive and the place was clean.
5651579,307577104,2018-08-14,172239010,Ellen,"We enjoyed our stay in Gregg's cozy studio. Extremely close to the plaza and museum, as well as other restaurants and cafes. We were able to walk everywhere. Gregg was great with communication, and advised us ahead of time about the alternate street parking for one night during our stay. <br/>Would definitely recommend.<br/>"
5651579,310472546,2018-08-19,164332733,Henry,was good and would go back again
5651579,311612705,2018-08-21,101075129,Megan,"Greg was nice but it was a creepy and dirty basement apartment in a sketchy neighborhood with random items scattered all over the place, like a huge kitchen sink leaning against the wall opposite the apartments front door. We got there and even though the lockbox opened and we could get our keys, someone had locked it from the inside so we couldn't get in. After calling Greg to let us in, and seeing the state of the place, my friend and I immediately booked a hotel room online and stayed there instead."
5651579,312494447,2018-08-23,18357426,Arden,"The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the location perfect for walking to attractions as well as plenty of bars and restaurants. There's several parks in walking distance as well, including one across the street. It was a great spot in the heart of Albany. Greg was great at responding regarding my parking request, too. I recommend making arrangements for parking in advance, since it's a crowded historical neighborhood. And for me the old house and it's character are charming. I completely appreciated there was coffee and a few kitchen essentials to help me after a late night arrival after airline delays. Self check in is my favorite, and it was easy, even in the dark."
5651579,313022602,2018-08-24,145150034,Louis,"Gregg’s apartment was easy to navigate to, street parking was available, instructions were easy to follow, and the space was very clean. For a spot very close to downtown Albany, I’d highly recommend!"
5651579,315720669,2018-08-29,134956450,Sydney,You get the essentials at a great location and a great price; reserved on street parking is a big plus. Highly recommended.
5651579,316110233,2018-08-30,14292383,William,Great place and great location. I would stay here again.
5651579,318815890,2018-09-04,138977648,Maude,le logement est très bien situé! C'est également facile de trouver la clé et d'entrer. Il fait cependant très sombre dans la chambre puisque c'est au sous-sol. La connexion wifi est très bonne et la cuisine assez bien équipée! Parfait pour un couple ou personne seule.
5651579,321113237,2018-09-09,114570677,Bishoy,"Definitely a very simple and old/ “historic” place, which I mostly expected. The age of the building shows clearly. The bathroom was dark and missing some lights. The room seemed fairly clean except for an area where the floor hadn’t been cleaned well around some pipes from the wall. Not bad overall. It’s in a nicer looking area. But not too many walkable areas to go for food or anything like that."
5651579,324044683,2018-09-16,131777097,Laura,"this place was not as described. we thought we rented an entire apartment but it was a shared bathroom. our key also opened the other apartment door and vice versa. which meant anyone could enter our room. we were locked out when we came back when the other guest locked the first door from the inside. on top of all that, my husband was kept up all night by the noise coming from upstairs where the host lived."
5651579,324694476,2018-09-17,3142542,Sebastian,"Always a great stay at Gregg. Convenient location close to bars and restaurants, a few minutes walking to the bus station, the NY State museum, cathedral, Empire Plaza. 5 minutes taxi ride to the Amtrak station. Great amenities, Wifi, cable TV, coffee machine, microwave, etc. Gregg is always by his phone and ready to answer any question."
5651579,325040922,2018-09-18,137489984,Randal,"Perfect spot for my needs, would stay there again. Excellent communication with the host!"
5651579,329342005,2018-09-28,168360089,Dirk,"Having a big studio with kitchen facilities is great. So is the vintage house you have. Shops and restaurants are around. It is great that the house is very close to the New York State Museum, Archives and Library. The area is very quiet, so is Albany in general."
5651579,329734462,2018-09-29,132794235,Joseph,"This is the first negative experience I've had at an airbnb and I've stayed in many. There was a smell in the studio that gave me a headache, the fan in the bedroom and all the slats in the blinds in the kitchen were covered with grime and the furniture was all old and worn. I would not consider staying here again."
5651579,330396504,2018-09-30,62410492,Domonick,Great spot close to Downtown Albany. Was in town for a wedding and it worked out great.
5651579,330997876,2018-10-01,16448151,Kevin,"Great location - about a five minute walk to the state capitol area and to restaurants. Gregg was very accommodating and let me check in early. Room was pretty large and good value overall. Downside: although it's listed as an ""entire apartment"", the bathroom is in a common area outside of the room and I think shared with another Airbnb room."
5651579,332112115,2018-10-04,91563994,Paula,"Quick responses, great location. Felt like home."
5651579,332992799,2018-10-06,191538221,Steven & Jamie,The room you stay in is not upstairs in the house. Walking distance to downtown. Served it's purpose for the night.
5651579,334208720,2018-10-08,75497516,Justin,"Great location, very quick responses and communication, easy check in and check out."
5651579,337523995,2018-10-16,123953107,Susan,"street parking is a little tricky. if you have a car, you must move it across the street each night.  And it's cool at night in this basement studio, but there are extra blankets and a space heater in the closet"
5651579,338099190,2018-10-18,1660760,Taraleigh & Dan,Gregg’s Place was so great and such an excellent value. The location was perfect and we’ll be back.
5651579,338791937,2018-10-20,220845131,Shepard,It’s good
5651579,340336617,2018-10-23,137725755,Nick,Gregg had great communication and was very helpful throughout my stay!
5651579,340933296,2018-10-25,25079994,Soraya,"I spoke with Gregg and shared my thoughts about the lack of cleanliness throughout.  Hopefully, he will quickly finish updating the kitchen and bathroom and improve the cleanliness of the space."
5651579,343116954,2018-10-30,24863911,Wanda,"La habitacion esta muy bien equipada, el baño es amplio y limpio. La cama es super comoda. <br/>Gregg no permite que ingreses a la habitacion con calzado, lo cual ayuda a que el piso se vea bien mantenido al ser una casa antigua.<br/>Recomendamos el lugar!"
5651579,344025320,2018-11-02,136964547,Patrícia,Very nice place!
5651579,346423554,2018-11-08,5813686,Steve,"I like the location of this place, and the fee is reasonable.  One should know that the bathroom is located just down the hall from the room, which wasn't a problem for me.  The room, itself, is like a studio apartment, with a kitchen and plenty of room, and includes some nice older furniture pieces.  Queen-sized bed, wifi, cable.  The bathroom is clean and provides various liquid shower soaps/conditioners in case one forgets their own.  Towels, of course, are provided.  It is the garden (lower) level so one should not expect beams of golden sunshine basking the entire space, but for me it doesn't matter because I am not there very much during the day.  My interactions with Gregg have all been prompt, helpful and nice.  I would definitely recommend this place."
5651579,347555988,2018-11-11,13996188,David,Having rooms with other people I didn’t know or have an opportunity to meet was unnerving. I left in the middle of the night because of screaming and banging upstairs. There were people and a dog running up and down stairs all night. Around 3 am it sounded like fighting broke our upstairs. I walked into the shared bathroom at one point and the floor was soaked and the faucets were running. My rental car was broken into and the neighborhood was sketchy. I learned there had been a shoot out the night  before.
5651579,350044673,2018-11-18,226201806,June,"Small studio, one bed, shared bathroom with other guests but for most part accommodating. Our sitter canceled last minute so decided to try Airbnb instead of spending over $200 for a few hours at a hotel since we live a little over thirty minutes away. It was only a ten dollar cab to get to the palace. If it was warmer we could have walked. We cooked a nice dinner before we went out so that saved us money on a restaurant too. The show was amazing. The bed was very comfortable. I know reviews are important when making a decision so over all I would definitely recommend it but you do get what you pay for. My daughter said it was the best time ever and we had just arrived back home from a trip to Nevada and Arizona!"
5651579,350554433,2018-11-19,59090108,Michael,"Gregg is a great host. Quick to respond and direct in his answers, he makes your stay simply enjoyable."

5651579,355979940,2018-12-06,57166063,Chelsea,"Gregg’s place is a great deal! For being 1/4 of the price of anything in the area, you can’t ask for more. The bed was very comfortable, the shower had great water pressure and stayed hot, and there’s plenty of amenities to make your stay comfortable (tv, full kitchen, large room). Gregg was also very prompt to respond to questions and flexible. Location is great too. Walkable to government buildings and lots of restaurants/bars."
5651579,356213916,2018-12-07,9872692,Oriol,"Top location. Nice room. Shared, clean bathroom."

5651579,369426508,2019-01-10,10632251,Sebastian,Really convenient for getting to the Capitol and the Plaza. Full kitchen which was nice.
5651579,400554286,2019-01-12,12510668,Cleveland,Gregg is a very flexible and fair host and offers great spaces where one can relax and decompress. Thank you for allowing me to stay with you. Will definitely be booking soon!
5651579,401676757,2019-01-15,235778248,Michael,"Really great host, super responsive when I had a question. Really considerate with amenities for me"
5651579,402189189,2019-01-17,46808479,Jonathan,"This is great location for downtown, and a great value. I had to be at the Convention Center and it was a block away. It is a vintage space, but large and comfortable. Great little kitchen as well. Shared bathroom in the hallway. Gregg was an excellent and prompt communicator, and eager to accomodate."
5651579,402480480,2019-01-18,52102246,Scott,Wash clothes and soap a must

5651579,406139585,2019-01-28,164905719,Wazib,"It' was a great place to stay, everything was  pretty close to his house. Gregg met me and my girlfriend for a few minutes, and they were welcoming us well"
5651579,406679193,2019-01-30,11849401,Janice,"The location is convenient and the neighborhood seems quite walkable, although I cut my visit short due to weather conditions. Gregg was quick to fix the W-Fi problem we encountered. Despite the extreme cold, we were quite comfortable in the flat. We didn't cook, so I can't comment on that aspect."
5651579,407000116,2019-01-31,186605248,Matt,"Great basic accommodations at a fair price. Good location, excellent communication, easy check in. Thanks again!"

5651579,411511559,2019-02-12,63800783,Rebecca,Gregg's place is charming and comfortable. Lots of space and a super comfortable bed. Very homey. Gregg is also as nice as can be and very responsive.  It's a perfect for anyone who will be doing work at the Capital; it's a 5 min walk away. I will definitely be staying there again.
5651579,412091064,2019-02-14,26438759,Nicole,Very accommodating to our last minute request.
5651579,412832824,2019-02-16,19658470,Alfredo,If I am in Albany I usually stay with Gregg.  He has several locations that are conveniently located.  He makes check in easy with a lockbox.  Also the pictures are a good representation of what the rooms look like.  You definitely get good value for your money.   Definitely the spot for you if you are looking for value in a convenient location.
5651579,413937064,2019-02-18,199702489,Rebecca,"This apartment was in a good location and street parking was easy to find. We stayed for a weekend in the winter and the apartment was comfortable, clean, and easy to find."
5651579,416981934,2019-02-25,100838801,Bruno,Great Location & easy check-in. Greg was very responsive and Helpful!

5651579,425569020,2019-03-18,3142542,Sebastian,"A great stay as always. Stylish historic house, separate apartment with a full kitchen, right downtown, a stone's throw from the Empire Plaza and New York State Museum."
5651579,425991672,2019-03-19,26120422,Amy,Gregg’s place was very convenient for the concert we attended at the Times Union Center. Comfortable and easy!
5651579,426265369,2019-03-20,102162218,Talitha,The location was excellent for site-seeing and was really cute!
5651579,426961931,2019-03-22,72105932,Crystal,The place was easy to find. The studio was clean and the bed was comfortable.
5651579,427373362,2019-03-23,80111968,Joe,"Very nice space— note that you share a restroom with one other studio. Apart from that, the place is great value."
5651579,428626666,2019-03-25,48131617,George,"Great location, very clean and comfortable."
5651579,431139870,2019-03-31,48277988,Peter,"Wonderful, wonderful location! The place is not modern, but very clean and has great character. I enjoyed having kitchen facilities in  the large Studio. Hope to stay there again next year!"
5651579,431665853,2019-04-01,824452,Will,"7 Madison has a great location near the State Plaza, so it's great for government business.  Little Little Italy awaits nearby with gorgeous cuisine. Try V&R! Just down the hill a bit. Take a night cap at the Empire Bar, promoting only New York Beer, Wine, Liquor and edible delights. Sleep well in a cozy, historical chamber."
5651579,433489559,2019-04-06,183785869,Ryan,"Very good host. The house is very old and could<br/>Use updating,  but overall I had a great experience."
5651579,436255775,2019-04-12,182995225,Benjamin,This is a great place to in the heart of downtown Albany.  It within walking distance of great restaurants and museums.  Gregg is very friendly and accommodating.   He is a great host!
5651579,436659917,2019-04-13,160671951,Abdulsalam,Great place
5651579,437419883,2019-04-14,177712615,Christopher,"It's a pretty simple, straight forward space to sleep.  Location was key for us, very central, within walking distance to our plans."
5651579,439778350,2019-04-19,53222010,Kristina,"The location is good, just a few minutes walk to the New York State Museum. The room is right under a living room(?) upstairs, and most of the evening I heard the family above me walking and moving about upstairs. One night's stay was enough me."
5651579,441006970,2019-04-21,63053146,Pavel,Gregg has a great positive attitude and is a pleasure to do business with
5651579,442010017,2019-04-22,256281334,Roberto,"Easy check-in, very spacious room, very clean, very comfortable bed, quick response from host, great choice for the price, great location."
5651579,443760342,2019-04-26,64044741,Laura,"This studio apartment is located on the lower level of a beautiful old row home facing a small park, on a quiet, one-way street in downtown Albany. There were not too many walk-able restaurants or shops that I was able to see, so be prepared to drive, or to call Lyft or Uber if you want to explore the city. The room/studio was nice and large, and there was an en-suite kitchen, but as the listing states, the bath is shared. That was fine the first night I stayed, but during my second stay (I liked the place well enough to return), another family had rented a nearby room, and while I don't know how many folks were there (at least two or three, by the sound of it), the bathroom was in high demand. Since the house is old, the floors are a bit noisy as other tenants move about, and sound carries, so if you're a light sleeper, you will want to bear this in mind and bring earplugs. The room itself was clean and comfortable, and I have to say that I absolutely loved the bed, which had a memory-foam topper that was like sleeping on a cloud! Gregg was a helpful and responsive host. I enjoyed my stay in Albany and if I return again, I will definitely check availability on this Airbnb first."
5651579,448032559,2019-05-04,198394516,Michelle,Great location for conferences and concerts in downtown Albany. Walked to my conference. Italian restaurants and McDonald's in walking distance as well. Kitchen space a plus if looking to save some $$ on food.  Would book again.
5651579,449389656,2019-05-06,5179342,Mike And Ann,"Albany,<br/>Thank you for booking seven Madison Place. I have keys in the lock box underneath the steps to the right of the door. The top lock box code is 1964. Take the keys out and open up the door underneath the steps. Once inside go straight down the hallway the studio is there. If you have any questions just call me at 518-852-8974 thank you Gregg  <br/>Lark street. <br/>Oh dear what a disappointing joint. Little natural ventilation and poor natural light. Bathroom is a small and dimly lit affair (no windows) which you might share. The total lack of ventilation including NO exhaust fan is problematic especially if sharing with strangers. Access was dingy and a bit difficult. The most reasonable thing here is it’s location - this is strictly a place you’d only sleep in as the bed (and the place generally) was clean and comfortable. The picture on the Airbnb site is not where you stay. You stay under the stairs that you can see. You hear every step, tap and flush together with some muffled conversation from the people who live right above you - but we could live with that - some might not. The kitchen was rough - with little in the way of welcoming goodies - one can live without a chocolate heart on the pillow but some milk in the frig would have been nice. No host input unless you ring him. At least Gregg sounded reasonable and he was helpful when we needed to leave our bags here for 3 hrs after checkout. Regrettably this place needs much more than that. As an experience it certainly was not a great one. It represents poor value for money and would at just about any price point. In a way this joint is an analogue of Albany itself - lovely architecture but a disgrace in terms of poor roads and run down infrastructure. This is a poor offering and may give Airbnb a poor name. We were super hosts from 2013 until 2017 and if we had received a review this bad we’d go into terminal depression and then slit our throats. It’s a bit hard to write such a damning review especially when Gregg seemed so accomodating."
5651579,450193367,2019-05-08,4124168,Daeha,Highly recommended for those visiting Albany.
5651579,450491915,2019-05-09,160162800,Isabelle,"Great location, privacy, easy access easy to park the car, very secure area <br/>Wonderful<br/>Thank you  Gregg"
5651579,451355705,2019-05-11,56990905,Kristie,"If you are looking for a swanky, modern, or crystal-clean place, this is not it.  But, if you are looking for a VERY convenient, economical place in a GREAT location - then this is the place for you!  Gregg made everything so easy by taking care of our parking permit and leaving a key for us.  My husband and I were visiting Albany for the first time, and went to a concert at the Times Union Center.  This was the perfect place to stay!  We were able to walk everywhere - to the concert, to the bar on the corner for a drink, to Empire Plaza to do site-seeing, etc.  The bed was comfy, we felt safe here, were able to throw some snacks in the fridge, make coffee in the morning, and take a warm shower.  My only suggestion if you stay here is to bring slippers or fuzzy socks (and maybe a bathrobe) because the bathroom is shared, and the floors are wood and a bit dusty.  :)"
5651579,453317920,2019-05-15,241455693,Jean,Gregg is a wonderful host and this is a great location if you have business at the Albany Capital Buildings.
5651579,454098468,2019-05-17,252208671,建国,Great suite to live in.
5651579,460581193,2019-05-29,27212307,James,Gregg was very friendly and accommodating. Great place near heart of Albany.
5651579,463056366,2019-06-02,6207748,Elizabeth,"Very clean, lots of room. Open and spacious, not at all cluttered. Always found parking close by."
5651579,467654497,2019-06-10,37005764,Matthew,Gregg was a fantastic host and his place is exactly advertised. I had a great stay overall and would definitely stay again.
5651579,469383218,2019-06-14,233996791,Amira,"Not like anything I’ve expected. It was a strong dog smell (allergic to dogs) in the hallway, the room had a strong weird smell, nothing looked like they were cleaned. I ended up not staying there."
5651579,469908135,2019-06-15,223722852,Esther,"Die Kommunikation mit Gregg war super, immer schnell und freundlich.<br/>Er war sehr um die Zufriedenheit bemüht und hat sich auch liebenswürdiger Weise um die Parkgenehmigung gekümmert . Top!!<br/>Leider kann ich die anderen Bewertungen nicht ganz nachvollziehen. Als ich den Raum betrat blieb mir die Luft weg, da es sehr nach abgestandenen, feuchten Keller gestunken hat. Es gibt einen kleinen Ventilator im Raum, habe mich nicht getraut die Fenster zu öffnen, weil die aussahen als wenn die dann auseinanderfallen. Die Gardinen waren auch nicht ansehnlich. Ich mag gerne alte Möbel aber dort ist ein Sammelsorium an alten Möbeln die wohl nur den Raum füllen sollen, mit fleckigen Polster etc. Man konnte jeden Schritt über einem hören, nicht gerade leise. Was mich leider nur kurz schlafen ließ.<br/>Das Bett ist extrem weich, man liegt total durch, ein Topper soll es besser machen, aber das ist geschmackssache. Das Bad ist im großen und ganzen sauber.<br/>Ich würde weder noch einmal dort übernachten, noch weiterempfehlen. <br/>Das tut mir sehr leid.<br/>Ich gehöre zu den Menschen die nicht viel brauchen aber dort habe ich mich nicht wohl gefühlt."
5651579,471979995,2019-06-18,3056559,Dan,Gregg’s place is super close to the Capitol and right down he street from a couple of great bars (with good food).  Much larger than expected. Well appointed. Very good bed.
5651579,472886469,2019-06-20,77552583,Matt,"Everything Gregg describes is accurate.  I will say there was a slight smell if petroleum throughout the apartment. This is probably because the studio is in the basement. I assume there was a home heating oil tank nearby.  <br/>Also, it was hot and humid and I was disappointed to not have air conditioning in the summer.  But that’s my fault for not noticing it wasn’t in the description.  Overall, a great location and the price is a good value."
5651579,474963902,2019-06-23,115563263,Vincent,"Good place, but the bathroom was located outside the apartment and the price was a little more than what it should have been."
5651579,481292648,2019-07-04,85985384,Evan,"Great apartment, amazing location.  Gregg is super responsive and ready to help if anything comes up!"
5651579,483399107,2019-07-07,111152049,Tracy,"The room was adequate for an over night. Easy walk to some sights. But there was a damp, musty smell in the entryway, hall and room. Bed was very soft.  Bathroom sink was a bit dirty."
5651579,485342042,2019-07-10,270600062,Grad S.,"If given the opportunity, I will look to stay here again."
5651579,500092451,2019-08-01,246430871,Ayana,"This was a nice space. However, the check in was late and the neighborhood is not as described via google. I tried to plan out this trip with staying at another air BnB for 2 days, then this air BnB for the next two days. I checked out of my first place at 11 AM and walked to the block past this place. There was supposed to be a coffee shop I was planning on reading at for 4 hours (Google and Yelp recommended). The coffee shop is permanently closed and was being used by squatters. Had to take an Uber up about a mile to a different coffee shop. Then finally was able to check in (2pm) to my new air BnB. Get there and there are dirty towels in the room, the bed is not made, the trash is full and there is trash around the room. This is pretty stressful, because I specifically planned out my day to study at the coffee shop, then at the desk in the room, at the air BnB. Left to clear my head and calm my nerves. Called Greg. He was very responsive and told me he would be down to turn over the room in a bit. When I returned the bed was made and the room was clean. The place was pretty clean and there was a laundry machine which was nice. The bathroom was very clean. It is not attached to the room. The kitchenette came in handy as well. It was stressful to plan out a trip based on the schedule, then come to find out my schedule was completely messed up. The house is nice and historic, I was just planning the trip around my Bar Exam which was a very stressful time and this process was an unforeseen additional stress. The room itself was fine. Besides the check in, it was good and Greg was a good host."
5651579,512652791,2019-08-18,13188826,Valeriu,Ok place.
5651579,516695353,2019-08-24,39373068,Joe,"Nice small comfy room with the necessities needed for day to day.  Greg lives on the property and is very attentive if needed.<br/>Property is next to Empire State Plaza not far from Lark & Madison where you can find new and trendy restaurants.  Greg can suggest on things to do in the area as he is a long time resident and have a great suggestion on authentic Italian eatery, Capreccio nearby.<br/>The only downside is a questionable neighborhood pocketed a couple blocks away which is self contained but doesn’t seem to interfere with the property.<br/>Overall I would recommend staying here!"
5651579,524824103,2019-09-06,105713410,Bruce,Spacious and clean.  Easy access to downtown
5651579,532862455,2019-09-20,12400525,Ed,"I was disappointed in Gregg’s place. He was very responsive prior to my stay, which was good, and assured me I would have access to a washer and dryer (we were staying there after two weeks abroad and desperately needed to do laundry). The washer was filled with dirty clothes and water when we got there and had a pair of pliers on it, so I believe it was broken. <br/>Further, The apartment and common hall had a fair amount of stuff lying around (used furniture, etc.). <br/>You may decide the place is worth it given the price, but it was old, cluttered, and not as described in my opinion. <br/>I have used Airbnb’s around the world and am not picky, FYI."
5651579,534358475,2019-09-22,102915257,Colter,Exactly as described. Check in process was very easy and room was all we needed for the night!
5651579,537411218,2019-09-28,236118059,Nakia,"Ok stay a but outdated and smells like I stayed  at grandma and grandpa house,  no working refrigerator  so my groceries  had gotten spoiled and didn’t want to put in the effort into calling about problems due to a short stay but location is dead smack of downtown Albany I can rave about that"
5651579,538171712,2019-09-29,57644159,Lou,"Ok, fairly clean."
5651579,540490838,2019-10-03,43799238,Ronald,A comfortable space steps away from the Empire State Plaza. A great spot for anyone in town doing government business.
5651579,542464309,2019-10-06,53605558,Jon,"Large studio with kitchen. Great price for location. Be aware: bathroom is not in unit, it is shared with another rental unit."
5651579,551629227,2019-10-20,234588324,Kenesha,Great host! Highly recommend this host.
5651579,558121275,2019-11-02,3789165,Lisa,Really appreciate GREG allowing me to check in last min. After 1030pm .  Big apt but the accommodations are old and TV wasnt working.  Not sure if the heat works since the electric radiator was offered. Comfortable bed and pillow.  Location is only 10 mins. Walk to capital and state st.
5651579,561053226,2019-11-08,301342865,Vito,It wasn’t home.  But for the short time I was in the place it sufficed. It is an easy walk to the Albany Center.  I found parking close to be difficult.  The t.v. didn’t have a signal.   It is obvious the place is going through a renovation process.
5651579,566469001,2019-11-19,217988582,Al,"What a dump. Dingy smelly dirty cold little basement decorated with Miss. Havisham furniture.  A blatant odor of burned gas out of stove, bunch of bmalfunctionig lights  and an unresponsive host who in 2019 came up with an excuse of internet unavailability as the reason for his lack of timely communication."
5651579,576165668,2019-12-12,21807198,Dušan,"Nice place, great location."
5651579,587117438,2020-01-02,21662529,Teresa,Nice place. Gregg was responsive in communication. Bed is comfy and overall place was a good deal. Would definitely return.
5651579,596365738,2020-01-22,297197530,Andy,"Plenty of space, accommodating host bang next to government center, with street parking to boot."
5651579,596730202,2020-01-23,69892354,Kwonsun,great host and super responsive.  he will try his best to accommodate for flexible check in and check outs
5651579,605933318,2020-02-15,19658470,Alfredo,"Gregg’s place is great value.  You are walking distance to the Albany capital center and the state capital.  If you are in town for business and on a limited budget, this is the place.  I have stayed here several times over the years and could not be happier."
5651579,617030117,2020-03-11,314568455,Sam,"Gregg was a great host.<br/>But this property needs a lot of upgrading, wallpaper, furniture A complete overhaul wouldn't be bad. Keep the comfy bed."
5651579,622357091,2020-04-13,166400619,Luke,"Pretty good place, great location, Gregg is a great host"
5651579,629706735,2020-06-14,166400619,Luke,"I stayed at Gregg's place for a total of about 2.5 months. I haven't booked short term airbnbs in the area, but for longer term rentals I think this is the best deal in the area. It's roomy, ideal location, great hosting, has all amenities you could need and at the best price in the area. It's basement level, but has a wall of windows in back and is not facing the street so it's quiet. I usually parked around a 5 minute walk away but finding a spot is almost never a problem"
5651579,637806488,2020-07-13,346799202,Ross,"super clean and comfortable, at a fantastic location. highly recommended!"

5651579,822526420145378641,2023-02-08,4370480,Steven,I had a great stay at Greg’s apt. It is an excellent location for anyone visiting the state buildings. Greg was super nice and very helpful as a local guide.
5651579,841388714029002435,2023-03-06,503434447,Keira,"I was hesitant to use AirBnB after a less than ideal experience in an affordable hotel in the area- but after staying here I’ll now exclusively use AirBnB over any hotel stay! Not only was it in my budget for the time I wanted to stay, but it was also right in town and I could see and experience Albany Central up close. The studio was way bigger than I’d expected and the kitchen was easy to use. It even had an electric kettle! I highly recommend this stay for anyone new to the area looking for an immersive city stay :) As someone new to the area I felt safe and comfortable; Gregg responded fast and was there for any questions I had."
5651579,845665363630197702,2023-03-12,357327806,Tiffany,"huge apartment, private and spacious. great value for the space except the smell of old, and aged and excessive dust upon entry."
5651579,848606593341768498,2023-03-16,420004839,Jackelynn,Gregg is an amazing host! He is very responsive and helpful. It truly was a pleasure. I would definitely go back.

5651579,855139792047252672,2023-03-25,12404722,Audra,"Gregg was a super responsive host, and his space was very convenient to walking to the Albany Capital Center. Gorgeous block of row homes with a rich history. Recommended!"
5651579,859466141752810538,2023-03-31,505401421,Quinn,"Big space, peaceful street, easy highway access, friendly and responsive host"
5651579,866642799226660851,2023-04-10,103492222,Nathalie,"Vous adorerez son emplacement, il est près de tout ce qu'il y a à visiter de plus populaire, qui est marchable par de belles journées sinon il y a du transport en commun tout près. N'allez pas au quartier plus bas et vous allez être correct. Pour les restos et épiceries, cest dans le quartier situé plus haut. Très calme comme endroit et le studio est complet et très confortable. Si vous désirez vous évadez un peu plus, allez vers la banlieue, très jolie. Plus bruyant en ville, ça va de soit! Une expérience très culturel et architecture à l'avant plan."
5651579,870247639084514770,2023-04-15,162895451,Pamela,Gregg is a great host. He is a wonderful person and takes time to make sure all is well. Thanks for a great stay!
5651579,875405279629302323,2023-04-22,423979432,Marcela Francisca,"Me gustó mucho la estadía, un apartamento completo por buen precio , muy bonita la fachada se la casa y cerca de la estación de trenes. Muy cómodo y práctico, me gustó el sistema que utiliza Gregg con las llaves. Definitivamente si debo volver a Albany volvería al mismo alojamiento."
5651579,884846355410236617,2023-05-05,148463375,Michael,Within walking distance of The State Archives where I was doing research. Recommendation for good place to eat was dead on.
5651579,887729636337914259,2023-05-09,322457299,Althea,"Gregg is a great host. Very responsive and helpful. Location is in a quiet area on a tree lined street. Close to restaurants, bars, public transportation, highways, the Capitol Building and surrounding areas. Neighborhood is walkable with a little park in front of the building. The studio has a kitchen with utensils and all you need. The bed is comfortable and the lockbox to enter is user friendly. Bonus washer/dryer in unit. Parking: read the signs and/or clarify with Gregg. He’s awesome."
5651579,916722602300962302,2023-06-18,319629400,Gabrielle,"Gregg was super nice and responsive. This unit is in the basement and also has dated amenities. This street felt relatively safe, but the immediate neighborhood was variable. There is street parking and you will have to move your car on sundays and mondays to the opposite side for street cleaning. Overall it was close to where I needed to be for work and got the job done for an extended stay."
5651579,921070859134268578,2023-06-24,62585053,Steve,Quaint basement space.  Wish there had been comfortable sitting space. Everything else was very nice.
5651579,936975913811619582,2023-07-16,521621609,Teri,Very peaceful and quiet.
5651579,944228428712694762,2023-07-26,149245586,Martin,Gregg is super friendly and responsive - The location is super downtown and the place is spacious with everything you need! Highly recommend!
5651579,946406730997478925,2023-07-29,482914840,Jim,"My goal in booking Gregg’s place was to give my wife a few days of relaxing respite from her daily travel schedule.  By booking this place we were closer to where she receives treatment. From start to finish getting there, getting in, and enjoying our stay was so simple thanks to Gregg’s clear communication, well appointed apartment, and check ins made this exactly the getaway we needed.  Having the Empire Plaza practically across the street was great, too!  Thank you, Gregg.  It was a pleasure to meet you and we  are so grateful for your hospitality!"
5651579,950712645892605866,2023-08-04,175914942,Jugba,"Gregg is an excellent host. His place was very comfortable, peaceful and centrally located downtown. I highly recommend it."
5651579,958721367603854052,2023-08-15,527692059,Thomas,Nice location beautiful view of downtown. Large Studio with kitchen and bathroom. Nice park right in front where people come to walk their dogs.
5651579,964471384745062877,2023-08-23,263086463,Greg,"Cozy unit, very well stocked with pretty much everything you need and a great host! Would come back"

5651579,973171165263641707,2023-09-04,99131420,Katie.FGW@Gmail.Com,"Gregg’s spot is in a very convenient spot and there’s a lot of space — between the sitting area, kitchen and bedroom. The inside is a bit dark and the furnishings are on the older side. But Gregg was very responsive and it was a good stay!"
5651579,976097924573971750,2023-09-08,72960530,Ian,"Gregg's place offers excellent value for the money. While branded as a studio apartment, the studio is very, very large! It is located on the lower (basement) level, which was very nice during a hot late summer week. I barely needed air conditioning at all! The studio is well-appointed and has what you'd need to cook a meal. In-unit laundry was a final very welcome perk. I would say that Gregg's place is perfect if you're looking for somewhere for 1-2 people right near downtown/capitol area. It was great for me for a 1 week work trip, and I'd stay again."
5651579,983394706450927753,2023-09-18,20698101,Matthew,Gregg's apartment was in a great location and easy check in.
5651579,1009520485138848631,2023-10-24,530387686,Harold,Great place. I know Albany very well so was well placed I’ll be back in 6 weeks hopefully place available thanks
5651579,1011589420254397840,2023-10-27,500065827,Becky,Gregg is great! The place was squeaky clean with all the basic amenities. You can’t beat the location if your plan is to visit the Capital Center!<br/>   I’ve stayed at Gregg’s Air BnB before and I hope to stay there again!
5651579,1021860637135030926,2023-11-10,263086463,Greg,Second time here and had a great stay!

5651579,1081941387947838907,2024-02-01,540253479,Warren,Gregg was great.  Very responsive.  Thoughtful.  Place was as advertised.
5651579,1092094931079326868,2024-02-15,420004839,Jackelynn,it's always a pleasure  staying at Gregg's.  I felt right at home the moment I arrived. I look forward to staying again.
5651579,1094348674617781213,2024-02-18,523866222,Deborah,"Steps away from the Empire State Plaza. Easy walk to some sights. The room was adequate for an over night. But there was a damp, musty smell in the entryway, hall and room. Communication with Gregg was great, always quick and friendly."
5651579,1098653308436608993,2024-02-24,561824589,Charles,Pros:<br/>1) very inexpensive <br/>2) 10-15 minute walk to MVP & Egg<br/>3) Host was very responsive <br/>4) Host takes  care of street parking  permit￼ (permit needed to park in front of location during specific hours/days) <br/>Cons:<br/>1) overall VERY filthy <br/>2) one block away from a drug prone location <br/>3) paper thin walls (could clearly hear the guest conversation in the adjoining apartment)<br/>Summary:<br/>You get what you pay for.
5651579,1107297632420161041,2024-03-07,97602905,Chris,"Gregg was a very responsive and helpful host. Great location, within easy walking distance of Empire Plaza and downtown, and a short walk to the trendy spots around Washington Park."
5651579,1111710671645739432,2024-03-13,451371328,Hannah,"The studio was clean and had everything I needed for a few nights. It was easy to find and was a fairly short walk away from some cool sites (like the New York State Museum) and some cute coffee shops. Gregg was very proactive in terms of arranging my stay. I'll just note that to get from the front door of the building to the studio itself, you walk through a cluttered hallway with what seemed like a bunch of antiques in it. It wasn't a problem, it was just a bit of a surprise. Overall, a great stay!"
5651579,1120321796178750711,2024-03-25,30350742,Adélaïde,"We had a very nice stay at Gregg's place. The apartment is conveniently located near the downtown area, minutes from the MVP Arena for concerts/events, restaurants, bars or even the riverfront. Gregg was very proactive, friendly and helpful and provided some really good recommendations for dining out (Café Capriccio was absolutely amazing). The apartment was well-furnished and equipped with everything you could need for a short stay."
5651579,1124714056785448910,2024-03-31,120687371,Karin,"Great stay at Gregg’s place.  Walked to MVP Arena, breakfast at Stacks,  Easter mass at Immaculate Conception. Free parking too"
5651579,1127541549055072217,2024-04-04,277132086,Thomas,"Clean, quiet, and much bigger than expected! The space would be perfect for an extended stay, there was ample storage space available. <br/>This was perfect for a few days in Albany, I was able to walk everywhere."
5651579,1136300130838357308,2024-04-16,17923135,Terry,great find!<br/>close to the arena….<br/>clean and huge!
5651579,1139970168842183052,2024-04-21,392125120,Edwin,This cozy place has everything you need and is very accessible. Gregg was a fantastic host and was easy to reach if you needed anything. 10/10
5651579,1155193112658355482,2024-05-12,3008772,Brandon,"Gregg's place was conveniently located. Across the street from Empire State Plaza and walking distance to Downtown and Lark Street. Not a ton in the very immediate few blocks other than a couple bars, bodegas, and a diner, but some beautiful historic rowhouses to look at. The space was huge for a studio and on the ground floor to easy to enter with my bike. Quiet and a great deal price-wise compared to what I've got for size/location elsewhere. Gregg was very communicative. A good choice if you are looking to come to Albany and want to be close to everything without a car."
5651579,1163109736014741975,2024-05-23,312115959,David,"excellent place, a quick walk to the Capitol.  be sure to ask him for on-street parking permission as there is no non-resident parking except in expensive parking garages.  he has an online portal that allows him to plug in your license plate."
5651579,1164553823342728064,2024-05-25,159982869,Freya,"Good stay, wouldn’t necessarily recommend if you’re on your own. But the place was clean and bed comfy!"

We could not have asked for a nicer place to stay during our visit. We cannot thank him enough for helping to make our stay so memorable."
5651579,1178317486604439550,2024-06-13,115028744,Christopher,Everything was clean and the location for the event we attended was excellent. My wife was surprised by the older setting of studio apartment but pleased it was very clean. She is used to more modern settings. But if you are a history buff as I am you would find the setting most intriguing.<br/>Wonderful place just a few steps away for dinner and drinks before our concert.
5651579,1181176282083031774,2024-06-17,214189445,Ken,"Great, efficient space. Very convenient and nice private kitchen"
5651579,1181975329409547221,2024-06-18,530099064,Ebony,"It was a very spacious apt, fairly clean, affordable and in a nice area. It’s a nice place to stay for a night. The tub was kind of dirty and the WiFi didn’t work so I couldn’t watch tv. I arrived late at night and I personally didn’t feel comfortable contacting Gregg so late, but I’m sure he would have helped me.  The bed and floors make a lot of noise. Overall it was ok for just one night."
5651579,1185642307131191784,2024-06-23,404429214,Corey,Stay was amazing 100% going to stay again.
5651579,1191351219197375181,2024-07-01,276292145,Hsing-Hung,"The location is good. It is very close to the museum and Empire State Plaza. However, the room is old and there is always a noticeably annoying smell that I think make me somewhat allergic to it. It is not a pleasant stay at all."
5651579,1192161514578877883,2024-07-02,123595029,Michael,Amazing location close to everything you need in Albany. Big kitchen and bathroom. Gregg replies very fast and is really friendly. Highly recommended! :)
5651579,1195742814274825148,2024-07-07,43227662,Holly,"Great spot in Albany! One of my favorite neighborhoods with plenty to do and some incredible food. Parking was easy and spots were always available. If you are looking for a fancy place to stay, this may not be the place for you. The price was great and we felt the apartment was reflective of the cost. Nice place to stay on a budget with a very responsive host."
5651579,1196474900377601882,2024-07-08,27563897,Steven,Gregg was a wonderful host. Great location. Clean and relaxing.
5651579,1198643914298648818,2024-07-11,462750944,Barbara,"My only advice, if you have a car and Don’t know the area, talk to gregg to find the areas to park near the house. They change depending the day it is. There is alternate parking. Look for the signs on the side walks. The place is lovely.  Super roomy apartment/ studio for being in the city. Cute antique furniture. Perfect mini kitchen. The kindness i received from Gregg is beyond words. Thanks so much !!!"
5651579,1204427549371513863,2024-07-19,558724796,Leevon,The house was cozy and well kept and there were adequate amenities.

The place was perfect for taking the bar exam - walking distance from the general testing center and a 7 min drive from Albany Law School. The place was secure and spacious, and the area was quiet."

5651579,1217528540744166187,2024-08-06,312438206,Scott,Solid spot for our overnight in Albany. Plenty of space with decorative flair (large bedside tables a bonus) and well situated. Kitchen adequate (toned-down lighting and a couple of coffee mugs would have improved it). Overall comfortable and quiet for downtown.
5651579,1227657014927978958,2024-08-20,99771530,David,Great location!
5651579,1229743120501864808,2024-08-23,597002135,Sean,Gregg was quick to respond and laid out instructions clearly. Airbnb was exactly as advertised and great space for the price.

5651579,1232738970170412192,2024-08-27,573372093,Karissa,"Overall, this was a pretty good stay.  I had a lot of trouble getting in.  I got the keys out of the lockbox with no problem, but the doorknob on the outside door was broken.  I was unable to get in on my own and had to wait for Greg to come get the door open.  Thankfully, Greg was very responsive and kind.  Even once I was in, I had trouble getting back out that outside door as you really had to stick your shoulder into it to get it to open.  That was kind of a theme throughout the airbnb, there were several doors with weird locks or would get stuck.  On the more positive side, it was a huge plus to have a washer and dryer in the unit.  The neighborhood it is located in is cute and felt very safe."
6623339,34388886,2015-06-07,8016810,Stécie,"Our stay at Terra's appartment was way better then what we expected ! The place is even more beautiful then the picture ! You are near a beautifull street with little shops, restaurants and bars ! Quite central, there is a bus that passes right in front of the place ! This was one of the most comfortable bed we had ever slept inn ! Terra made everything possible to make us feel welcome. Everything about this stay in our trip was great ! Would recommend a stay there to anyone !"
6623339,34923623,2015-06-13,35514710,Doug,Beautiful space very clean and exactly as described.  Highly recommended to the Air BNB community
6623339,35054959,2015-06-14,940390,Derrell,Gorgeous apartment. Very spacious and comfortable. Near great spots in Albany (within walking distance).
6623339,35529210,2015-06-19,1158565,Amiee,"Terra was a great host. Nice, flexible and easy going. She checked on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. We loved the space which was very beautiful,  spacious and relaxing. I'd love to live here full time!  Located near Lark street with easy access to downtown, good food, coffee shops and bars. I will stay there again whenever I'm in town and if it's open. Highly recommended."
6623339,36047806,2015-06-24,35403440,Mary,"The listing was exactly what was offered: a lovely one bedroom apartment, well appointed in very secure building. Convenient to restaurants and walking distance to Empire State Plaza. Hosts met us when we arrived and checked us out. They were also very friendly, offered great ideas, and easy to communicate with! Great experience!
<br/>"
6623339,36347733,2015-06-27,474229,Joseph,Place was great!  Really nice apartment.  Pretty much the best location in town.  Terra was super responsive.  Would stay again!
6623339,36468984,2015-06-28,36353941,Julia,"Everything was great! The apartment was amazing, everything seemed new, was in great condition, and very clean. Terra was great and the location was perfect! :)"
6623339,36643791,2015-06-29,19027316,Leonie,Last minute stay which was amazing. Apartment is extremely nice and clean with good location to bars/shops/restaurants. 
6623339,36731459,2015-06-30,9007157,Cat,"Terra's place is beautiful. It's modern, spacious and clean. It's on a busy street, but we didn't hear a thing thanks to the apartment's thick walls. It was well equipped with a very comfortable bed and includes convenient parking. There are interesting restaurants right nearby. Highly recommended"
6623339,36990185,2015-07-03,35957214,Khiem,This was a great place to stay. The space was really nice and clean and chic. The location was right downtown. The host was great and gave us a spot in the private parking lot! Will return again whenever I am in Albany!
6623339,37367636,2015-07-06,31246473,Clara,"This apartment is truly stunning. It is absolutely beautiful and much larger than you'd think. Terra's place was clean and convenient, right in the downtown area of Albany. Both parking and check in were super easy and she was very accommodating. I would highly recommend staying here! "
6623339,37892938,2015-07-11,2902940,Liz,"Terra’s apartment is fantastic and very clean. Perfect downtown location, plenty of dining and entertainment options only a few steps away. Stop in for breakfast with Sam at Albany Coffee Shop a few blocks down Lark Street. "
6623339,38036247,2015-07-12,17788035,Meredith,"Listing description is exactly as pictured.  The apartment is beautiful, it's extremely clean, has nice amenities, and it centrally located to all the great spots in downtown Albany (walkable).  We stayed over on a Saturday night in the summer, which did lend to a lot of outside noise.  I had forgotten how rambunctious people can get in the summer time.... the apartment is ground level so we were woken up around 1am to a lot of people very noisily walking by, and it sounded like someone was having an outdoor party next to the building.  A couple of earplugs solved the problem for me, but my fiance didn't get much sleep.  This isn't unusual for a weekend in a city, so just be aware of when you are visiting and prep accordingly.  I still gave the apartment 5 stars because this was nothing within the host's control.  Everything provided by Terra was excellent and as described."
6623339,38350598,2015-07-14,2535580,Dorsey,"Great, spacious, comfortable apartment.  Centrally located with everything you need in walking distance.  
<br/>
<br/>Terra is a very accommodating, flexible, responsive host. "
6623339,38572737,2015-07-16,1856276,Palmer,"Terra's apartment was absolutely beautiful and spotless. It's super spacious with a full kitchen and laundry, so would be great for a longer stay than my 1 night. Arranging keys and the parking pass was seamless. I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks, Terra!"
6623339,38876422,2015-07-19,17524895,Sandi,"The location of this apartment is great--walking distance to Washington Park and the Capital.  You can walk a block to the grocery store, restaurants and coffee shops.  The apartment was spacious and clean and we had a parking spot! Check in and out was easy.  A great choice."
6623339,39239882,2015-07-21,36213939,Jennifer,"Terra was a great host - quick to respond and made my first AirBnB stay a breeze. This place is even better in person - clean, airy and close to everything. Even though I had a car, I didn't need to use it. I will be staying here when I am in Albany. Thanks for a great experience, Terra. "
6623339,39332163,2015-07-22,8968857,Emily,"Terra made our stay incredibly easy and convenient, and her apartment was clean and beautiful!  Would highly recommend."
6623339,39587014,2015-07-24,4353071,Fang Fang,"The apartment was wonderful. It was nice, clean and in a great part of town. Terra was very hospitable and flexible. She was extremely reaponsive."
6623339,40329164,2015-07-30,10127653,Mercedes,"Fantastic stay!! I stayed at Terra's apartment while sitting for the New York Bar exam, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The apartment was HUGE and incredibly beautiful! The building is a renovated fire station which gives the apartment a rustic feel, while not compromising on comfort with modern appliances (TV, Internet, washer/dryer, and a dreamy kitchen!) It was close to great restaurants and coffee shops, and a short walk to both the Convention Center and Times Union arena. I can honestly say this is the best place I have stayed in through Airbnb, it was simply stunning. As all other guests have said, Terra was a wonderful host, very attentive and accommodating! I absolutely recommend anyone staying in Albany to book this place, I know I definitely will if I visit again!"
6623339,42669725,2015-08-15,14802211,Loretta,"Terra was more than accommodating! She was extremely nice & was so easy to reach for whatever reason; a question, a request or a problem(which we really didn't experience). She responded immediately! She offered us an upgrade w/o additional charges & the apartment was absolutely beautiful! Our original apartment was very nice as well but smaller than the upgrade. Just loooove the location! There was everything that we needed & more that was walking distance including The Empire State Plaza & Washington Park. And most importantly it was walking distance from my daughter's & her boyfriend's apartment! We felt very safe as she has double locked doors w/a code to enter the building & 2 locks on your apartment door. Also another great feature is that you get an assigned parking spot in a lot, so no worries about finding parking on the street. We are so happy to have found this apartment on Airbnb & even more happier to have a great host that's so hands on. We are looking forward to renting again in the future from Terra! Thanks Terra for a great 2 weeks! "
6623339,56437760,2015-12-13,1542757,Christine,A very spacious and lean apartment in a vibrant neighborhood. Everything about the stay was great and Terra is a fantastic host.
6623339,57572114,2015-12-27,43043613,Jones,"The place was as described. Terra was very informative and very quick to respond to any questions I had. I would definitely choose this location again for a get away. 
<br/>
<br/>Parking was a plus!"
6623339,57713597,2015-12-28,1546971,Elizabeth,"The apartment looks exactly as it does in the pictures.  it is very comfortable and spacious.  We enjoyed our overnight stay here.  Very convenient location.  We didn't meet Terra personally but she gave very clear and helpful directions so our arrival was smooth - everything prepared for when we arrived.  if you are coming to Albany, I would definitely recommend Terra's place!"
6623339,57966154,2015-12-30,50808471,Lauren,"Such a great trip to Albany wouldn't have been possible if not for Terra's outstanding apartment and supreme hospitality. I went to Albany very last-minute, to surprise my boyfriend and stay a few nights in the city. He works there for 2 weeks each month, but never gets to enjoy it. I met up with him within minutes after he got relieved at work, and we had such a blast! From the second I arrived, up to the second I had to sadly leave my dream apartment, I was in heaven! It all started at the heart of Terra's place, that couch is like a cloud. Everything is beyond clean, comfortable, and open-wide with so much space. Washer and dryer available if you need it. The ceilings are high and if staying in the winter put the fan on low, heat rises and this was absolutely perfect for dispersing the toasty air all around. Best Dan ever! So amazing! Hmm, oh yeah, and saving the best for last: Terra went above and beyond writing an email to me with her own reviews of nearby restaurants and arranged them in order of price/location. I didn't get the chance to meet her, but I really wanted to! She has such a sweet place and I can't wait to stay there again. Two nights is the best, those closets make you never want to leave.. !They're the traveling girls best friend (make-up, clothes, selfies, haha.) Stay here, very awesome! Enjoy! "
6623339,58161502,2016-01-01,42670435,Amar,"Terra's apartment was great! It was clean, safe, well lit and very comfortable.  It's close to a lot of great bars and restaurants and the free parking can't be beat.  Self check-in was also a breeze."
6623339,58429463,2016-01-02,8613137,Melissa,"I was in town for a concert at the Palace Theater and this was a great apartment for an overnight stay. Although I didn't meet Terra in person, she remained very communicative throughout the trip and was always available for last-minute questions. "
6623339,59216380,2016-01-08,5238202,Richard,"My partner and I spent 6 nights at Terra's place.  Although the apartment wasn't the one in the post, it was directly above and was perfect!  The place is very large and very clean.  Although the weather was cold, down to single digits some mornings, the place was comfortable, not cold or drafty.  The location is great, lots of coffee shops, historic sites and restaurants nearby.  It's nice to have a parking space too!  Terra is very responsive to questions and always got right back to us.  I highly recommend this site and plan to use it in the future!"
6623339,59344529,2016-01-09,53501386,Stefano,"Very cool, large apartment near everything in Albany. Everything we need was in the apartment already.  Terra was amazing,  she was quick to respond & get us all set up. This was my first weekend using Airbnb, I'm just hoping every other host is just like Terra. Can not say enough good things about her & our stay.  Thank you so much. You're the best"
6623339,62467407,2016-02-14,54187087,J Alexander,Terra was extremely accommodating. She offered us restaurant recommendations and space heaters to stay warm (it was sub zero in Albany the weekend we were there). The place itself is beautiful and spacious. Highly recommended.
6623339,62791142,2016-02-16,58039245,Tiffani,"The apartment was beautiful. Comfortable, very clean, prime location. Getting into the building was easy and the on site parking was a great bonus given the location. Terra was very courteous and responded quickly. <br/>I am definitely looking forward to using this location again."
6623339,63541323,2016-02-24,18895693,Matthew,"Stayed for the purpose of sitting the NYB exam. Fully accommodated throughout and a great many thanks to Terra, Matt and Bo for all their help. Wouldn't look any further if I have cause to be in Albany again."
6623339,64329910,2016-03-02,2454750,Elizabeth,"I had a great time in this charming, historic building. Very spacious and clean. Memory foam mattress, Close to restaurants on Lark Street, and also walk-able (with a light suitcase) to downtown/capital hill. I was only hear one night but checkin-in and out was very efficient. "
6623339,64852961,2016-03-08,56759373,Pete,"Terra was a great host. Very accessible during pre rental and during our stay. We stayed upstairs in number 5, but that was no issue for us. That place had everything stated In number 2 and I liked being on the top floor.  Place was clean, building is quiet and we'd definitely stay here again. "
6623339,65073087,2016-03-10,33143187,Natalie,"Terra's apartment was more than we could have expected.  There was tons of space, and we were able to spread out.  It was clean and warm, and communication was easy.  There was something I needed while we were there, and Terra arranged for it to be brought to me very quickly.  "
6623339,65121359,2016-03-10,21662195,Scott,"The apartment I rented was not the one pictured.   I was a little surprised that the apartment I was assigned (#5) was not the ""stunning"" one advertised and pictured.   Unit #5 appears much less modern and less refined than the one in the photos.   However, this is more of an observation than a complaint.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment was clean, bright and had all of the basics required for a one night stay.   It's central to everything and right across the street from Washington Park with many restaurants nearby.   On site, off-street parking was a really nice perk in this busy city where parking is very limited.   
<br/>
<br/>Though I did not meet Terra, she was a perfect host - snappy replies to questions and check-in and check-out was a breeze.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>"
6623339,65336910,2016-03-13,36946563,Ann,"The apartment was in a renovated police station which was really cool! Very spacious, too bad we only stayed overnight. Very clean.  Very comfortable bed. Terra answered all texts immediately, was even gracious when I misplaced the keys to the apartment. Parking on premises. Easy walk to supermarket, and about 1 mile to Palace theater.  Would definitely stay again. "
6623339,66492599,2016-03-22,51894509,Joseph,"Terra was very accommodating with this property. When I booked she informed me that the apartment I originally wanted was taken for a month and that she had another larger apartment in the same building instead. I booked that room and we kept in contact until the reservation via text.
<br/> 
<br/>The place was easy to find, included parking and the building was secure behind two coded doors. The apartment was clean and included modern high-end appliances (washer & dryer included). Two big couches, a dining room table and a large island. Keep in mind this building was built in the 1800's and has some expected character. The bed was comfy though the room was stiflingly hot...a provided fan helped.
<br/>
<br/>The area was oddly desolate on a Sunday night, but there were many restaurants and other conveniences in close proximity. An easy walk to downtown! Would certainly repeat!"
6623339,66689815,2016-03-24,47542651,Emily,"Terra's place was great--clean, filled with light, in a great location with bars and restaurants nearby. Would definitely recommend!"
6623339,67811755,2016-03-31,9407818,Anthony,Great experience all around. It was a quick work trip to Albany. Terra was very responsive and totally flexible. The apartment is perfect and I will absolutely try to stay there again. Wonderful experience. 
6623339,68072973,2016-04-02,18324637,Brendan,"What a fantastic experience! Terra was a welcoming and super responsive host and the apartment was exactly as described. The physical building is really cool - any history buffs would do themselves a favor by booking here! The location of the space is also really excellent - food, bars, and downtown all super close. Well definitely keep this spot in mind for a future trip to Albany! "
6623339,68286425,2016-04-04,14802211,Loretta,This is my second time staying at the renovated Police Station & my husband & I are just as please with the accommodations as the first time. The apartment was very clean & very comfortable & love her taste in decorating.  She is extremely easy to get in touch with for whatever reason & whenever time. Highly recommend this apartment building. Two thumbs up
6623339,69155978,2016-04-09,15858147,Tamara,Terra was very accommodating of my friend and I during our stay in Albany and even generously upgraded our apartment to a larger space. The apartment suited our needs as we were only in town for a few days and it was very conveniently located. It was a little loud at night however it is in a downtown location and it was not a problem for either of us. Terra quickly responded to any questions I had and I would recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a place to sleep while traveling in Albany. 
6623339,71336178,2016-04-24,5965703,Kristin,Great space for a weekend stay within walking distance of grocery store and restaurants. Terra was accommodating and easy to reach. It was loud at night because of a neighboring bar (probably because it was a Saturday night) but the apartment itself is beautiful and comfortable.
6623339,72142227,2016-05-01,68904141,Esther Malka,"I unfortunately was unable to make the trip, however Terra was VERY understanding & reasonable. She's even allowing me to reuse the night for the future when I do decide to visit Albany. She's very quick with responses as well! She deserves 5 stars!! "
6623339,73124758,2016-05-07,42133314,Christopher,"Terra was accommodating to my tight conference schedule allowing me to check in early. The apartment is beautiful and spacious, plus the off street parking is a significant added value. My only criticism relates to the neighboring karaoke bar who's loud music and drunk singers could be heard inside the apartment. Is still did not have a problem falling asleep is the very comfortable bed. Just be advised if you are a light sleeper."
6623339,73382579,2016-05-08,68236158,Caroline,Beautiful apartment in center square. We have no complaints. 
6623339,73770342,2016-05-10,11459211,Josh,"Terra, as always, was a terrific host. She is always so friendly and helpful. Looking forward to the next stay!"
6623339,74072814,2016-05-13,67070734,Andy,"Terra's place was great. Clean, nice, easy entrance had everything that was needed.  Right in the heart of center square.  I will definitely stay again next time I'm in town."
6623339,74183548,2016-05-13,64315977,Archana,"We stayed at Terra's beautiful apartment in Albany for a very short period of time - just one night.
<br/>
<br/>We had initially booked another apartment belonging to Terra but as there was some repair work going on, Terra re-booked us into this apartment. But the re-booking was managed very smoothly as it was communicated well in advance and the address was the same, except it was another flat. 
<br/>She made sure that the apartment block was clean and was available to answer any queries. the apartment is beautiful, clean and large with very high ceiling and tastefully decorated interiors. There was ample space in the bedroom for us both and our little toddler. The kitchen was fully equipped and the WiFi worked well.
<br/>Overall, we had a good but short stay at Terra's property in Albany. It was also very close to the railway station, so it was easy for us to get a train to NYC the next morning."
6623339,74994580,2016-05-18,46591280,Sarah,"Easy check-in, large space in cute historic building! Terra was so kind, super flexible about check-in times, and everything on my very brief stay went smoothly! It's in a super convenient neighborhood with cute coffeeshop and food options closeby. Terra also thoughtfully leaves out tea and coffee, which was so lovely in the morning!"
6623339,75285492,2016-05-20,2019263,Elizabeth,"The unit was beautiful and host was very responsive and understanding, even when I was cranky during a traffic snafu. :) Would happily stay here again. Light sleepers would likely not handle the bar noise well, however. "
6623339,75841813,2016-05-23,1953754,Laval,"Communication with Terra has been excellent from booking to checkout. She accommodated our late arrival. The apartment is clean and spacious with all necessary amenities. The dedicated parking slot is a definite plus. Location is fantastic, within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, pubs and park. 
<br/>Be mindful though, patrons from the local pub may be loud until late night, especially during weekends. Ear plugs might come in handy. Overall, it's a great base to visit Albany. "
6623339,77005368,2016-05-30,20291205,Tabel,"Terra was great! She was so helpful and accommodating and was just one text away with anything we needed. The apartment is beautiful and clean with lovely decor. The listing description was accurate, it was a stunning apartment.  "

6623339,78927486,2016-06-10,25880148,Sabrina,Terra made my first AirBnB experience amazing. I was visiting a couple of friends who lived there and attended a nearby university to hang out for one final time (I am leaving the state of New York) and to celebrate two birthdays. I only stayed for one night but their apartment was very clean and conveniently located. Terra was also very prompt in her responses and very easy to speak to.
6623339,81424252,2016-06-23,5131125,Rafael,"Great host and apartment. The process was easy from booking to checking out. The apartment was spacious, very clean, and in a great downtown location. My main reason to visit Albany was to attend an event at the Empire State Center, and this apartment was very close and easy to get to. Highly recommend if you are traveling to Albany for either business or leisure. "
6623339,84080079,2016-07-05,13595993,Delphina,"My experience with Terra and her apartment was lovely. She picked me up from the train station and brought her to her apartment. The apartment was beautiful and well located- it is much bigger than the photos make it appear and has wonderful natural light. The place was clean and lovely to stay in, I would absolutely recommend this apartment. "
6623339,88738381,2016-07-25,33937148,Mel,"The apartment was just as awesome as shown on the site, maybe even better! It was in a great location and close to lots of cool places. "
6623339,88790723,2016-07-25,63820901,Ilana,This apartment was perfect for our night in Albany. It was spacious and clean.  We felt safe and at-home.
6623339,145209614,2017-04-17,114150202,Goldie,"We had a great experience with this apartment. We never met Terra, but checking in and out was flawless. She was available if we needed her, but everything was perfect so no help needed. The apartment was quite large with kitchen utensils, washer and dryer and a TV with great channels. This is a quaint building (old precinct) in a “funky” cool neighborhood. We really enjoyed looking at a lot of the homes that were pre-Civil War. There is a bodega around the corner for any forgotten items with a deli in the back. We arrived late (delayed flight), but went out for a walk and the neighborhood was safe. There are lots of pubs, pizza joints and corner restaurants. This was a leisure vacation and we were able to drive to Saratoga, Lake George and Waterford, NY easily. All local sights including State museum are within walking distance. My husband and I are near retirement age, but felt comfortable in this neighborhood with the students and professionals that live there. Terra provided a parking space/permit on property. This is a HUGE plus in Albany. Our rental was safe and we never worried late at night trying to find a spot to park. <br/>"
6623339,145918654,2017-04-20,17686760,Robert,Our stay was great and Terra's place is perfect and in a great location. She was very accomodating and friendly. Would definitely stay again. 
6623339,146366479,2017-04-22,65420882,Kristy,"Great place to stay, great host! Very clean and a great location "
6623339,146714437,2017-04-23,123415486,Rick,"This place was great. I wish my place in NYC was as nice. Really cool building, renovated police station. Could use a full length mirror somewhere in there, but come on, it's just a mirror. <br/>Host was great, communicated well, made everything easy. Thank you!"
6623339,147245851,2017-04-25,64672,Maura,This is a comfortable apartment for any length of stay. I liked the historic building and neighborhood. 
6623339,147590637,2017-04-27,1747005,John. (Bob),Great place in a great location. Albany is a pretty cool city and this is a great place to explore it from as your base camp
6623339,148441209,2017-04-30,467394,Jeannie,"Terra's place was perfect. It's located in a very convenient hip area. Lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. I didn't have a car, but I didn't need it. It was clean and large. It had everything I needed. <br/>Check in was very easy. The building is a beautiful old Police station from the 1800's so cool!"
6623339,151199597,2017-05-11,2535580,Dorsey,Great location.  Clean and comfortable with a nice historic decor/charm.  Terra is a fantastic host - communicative and accommodating. 
6623339,151831498,2017-05-14,17335252,Stephanie,The location of this apartment is fantastic; it's walking distance to many great bars and restaurants. The apartment itself has really high ceilings and is beautiful. There are many details in this apartment that make it one of a kind!
6623339,153299492,2017-05-20,10611256,Bonnie,Cool place in a great neighborhood. 
6623339,154451194,2017-05-24,123094046,Julia,"Nice, clean space. Well-equiped with all the basic amenities. Walking distance to the Albany Capital Center and other downtown destinations, so very good location for business travel. The neighborhood is lively... great for some people but may be loud for others."
6623339,156102786,2017-05-29,2740678,Emily,"This apartment is GORGEOUS and spacious and is near anything you need, since it's adjacent to Lark St. It's also really close to Washington Park, which is great. We had a wonderful time. Terra was easy to get a hold of, and super nice."
6623339,157801643,2017-06-04,96054712,Vered,Great place! Terra and her partner were very helpful and kind
6623339,158853792,2017-06-08,75301385,Serge,"I cannot recommend this place.  The photos and the term ""restored"" make it look clean and new.  I am confounded in how it has 74 five-star reviews.  The pictures do not accurately portray the poor condition of this building and apartment.  The kitchen cabinets and appliances were clean enough, as well as the shower, sink, towels, linens, etc.  The bed, sofa, and dining table were new enough.  The problem is with the lack of maintenance and the old bones of the place:  the many many layers of paint, which you can smell, are peeling, the ac vents in disrepair, the baseboards and especially the windowsills are filthy, the carpet in the bedroom and closet is worn and dirty, the bedroom door doesn't close, and worst of all, there were large insects. The entry is dirty, the stairwell and grounds in disrepair.  It is on the second floor, not the first as implied in the photos.  The location is very walkable to lots of hip and interesting parts of Albany, but the price does not justify the condition of this place.      "
6623339,159790137,2017-06-11,69039417,Emmanuel,Great place! Would stay here again!
6623339,161321910,2017-06-17,119355560,Veronica,"Terra's place is awesome. It's clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. It's in a cute, walkable, and eclectic neighborhood. The kitchen is great if you are planning on cooking or preparing food during your stay. Otherwise, plenty of awesome places to get food, drinks, and coffee nearby. I definitely recommend this place and would also stay here again in the future."
6623339,163835160,2017-06-25,136285245,Manny,"My girlfriend and I wanted to find a place to stay for the weekend that was centralised as we've never been to Albany. To put it plainly, this historic pad was smack dab in the middle of multiple craft pubs, kareoke bars and bustling cafes. We gorged on brunch, specialty pizza and pints upon pints of craft brews only to come back to ""our"" place and straight veg. Terra was an excellent host. From her communication, to the sheer amount of amenities supplied (guaranteed parking, for one). Reviews are subjective, and prone to bias but I can honestly say this place was well worth the money, and we wouldn't be opposed to staying here the next time wr decide to come up. "
6623339,164800232,2017-06-29,113822707,Keith A,"for the money, you are better off in a hotel"
6623339,165692856,2017-07-01,6927976,Simon,"Great apartment in a terrific location!<br/>Only problem is the noise - the bar next door had people in the courtyard past 2am on weekdays and past 4am on friday (this is the last time the noise woke us up on those days). We ended up having to play static from our phones, but we still got woken up lots."
6623339,189102264,2017-08-31,11492111,Gloria,"We stayed for the full month of August and really enjoyed Albany. Close to restaurants, the park, NYS museum. Lark St is unique and diverse with bars, coffee shops, etc. Terra was quick to respond when we needed a couple items early on. The only caution is that being summer, the courtyard for the nearby Oh Bar is noisy until the wee hours of the morning. No problem for my husband but I benefited from ear plugs."
6623339,190944150,2017-09-05,54855444,Dana,"This is an amazing place- clean and beautiful.<br/>Terra responded very quickly to our questions, and went out of her way to help us."
6623339,192586033,2017-09-10,117442227,Zemirah,Excellent clean space. Very pleased
6623339,194847958,2017-09-17,6200019,Erin,"Exactly as advertised, hosts were communicative, bed was comfy, place was clean! love the high ceilings."
6623339,197018855,2017-09-24,111679863,Deana,We had a great time! Perfect location and very easy to access downtown.
6623339,197717369,2017-09-26,9203748,Alexander,"Wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohlgefühlt und hatten schon überlegt, ob wir sie nicht dauerhaft mieten sollen ;-) Wir hatten nicht erwartet, dass es so ein großes, stylisches Loft ist und waren wirklich hochzufrieden."
6623339,198831691,2017-09-30,20808401,Kurt,Terra's place was in the perfect location of Albany! Super trendy apartment that was modern and clean! Highly recommend!
6623339,199698332,2017-10-02,139286937,Christel,Perfect little Last minute Condo in Albany!<br/>This place is perfect! Also includes parking which is awesome in Albany!<br/>Terra’s place is really nice and clean.<br/>The hosts replied very fast. This was awesome due to our last minute booking.<br/>I would recommend this place 100%
6623339,200248220,2017-10-04,3008927,Stanley,"Location, location, location!  This place is around the corner from Lark Street, very walkable and very roomy.  The New York State Museum is worth visiting.  We were given several good recommendations from the hosts and found Albany to be a gem."
6623339,200497225,2017-10-05,30259728,Chris & Melody,"Terra's place was in a great location, walking distance to the Capital. Her place was spacious and clean, super comfy.  Only downside was loud at night, even weeknight."
6623339,200780518,2017-10-06,3457688,Dawn,"Clean apartment in a convenient location with parking.  For a one night stay it worked for us, but the noise level throughout the night coming from the bar next door would have been problematic had we stayed longer."
6623339,201114923,2017-10-07,61973741,Jessica,It was a great place to crash for the night and explore around Albany.
6623339,202054807,2017-10-09,56656035,Alex,Excellent
6623339,202497940,2017-10-11,98296997,Yuren,"Good location, nice APT., great hosting."
6623339,202711055,2017-10-12,17356420,Karen,"Gorgeous, relaxing, unique space. Soft linens, walkable location, clean apartment. Grateful I landed here!"
6623339,203805551,2017-10-15,44314142,Christopher,"Communication was horrendous, host never replied to my several messages asking about how to get the key. Finally did a couple hours before my check in. Other than that, the apartment and location were awesome."
6623339,204336573,2017-10-17,63410724,Amber,wondereful place and great location!!! 5 stars
6623339,204516339,2017-10-18,154826425,Irina,"Awesome place to stay! Good and clean apartments, easy check in and convenient location. Highly recommend for those who plan to stay for a couple of nights."
6623339,205688770,2017-10-22,152898873,Wayne,Terras place is centrally located and roomy. It has all the ameninities needed for a one night stay. Unfortunately due to the large space it is quite dusty. Bars and restaurants are very close by and everything to see in Albany is within a quick walk or drive.
6623339,206058014,2017-10-23,30756866,David,"Beautifully appointed space, professional, spacious, clean and comfy. I would recommend this to any traveller wanting to be in a location in Albany with all of the amenities yet private enough to be able to escape. Highly recommended."
6623339,207603185,2017-10-29,2013005,Sebastien,"Had a good time back in Albany at Terra's place. She was very responsive and attentive. The place was clean and is actually bigger than the photos had conveyed -- which was a nice surprise. There is ample storage and the bed was particularly comfy. The downside, as many have reported, is the noise coming from the street and the bar under the windows. This was, however, clearly communicated in the listing and by private messages before booking. Now this can't entirely be blamed on the location. I've owned a house in this very neighborhood for more than a decade before moving to Colorado, and it's a great place to be. The windows, however, are problematic, to the point where I wondered if they were actually wide open -- they weren't. Installing double-paned windows in the bedroom would make this listing an instant recommendation. Until then, I would suggest light-sleepers to look outside of Center Square, or bring a solid pair of ear plugs."
6623339,208905154,2017-11-03,26564626,Chelsea,"Amazing air bnb experience !!! <br/>Extremely clean, spacious apartment. Large open floor plan with well appointed Kitchen. Laundry in the apartment was a huge plus. A really cozy spot for a little home away from home. <br/>The location right next to Lark Street and Washington Park is awesome. Short walk to great restaurants. <br/>As mentioned in a couple reviews , slightly loud throughout the evenings as it’s in a location near bars. Nothing ear plugs can’t fix in case you’re a light sleeper. <br/>Would definitely recommend to others :)."
6623339,209179002,2017-11-04,29026999,Heymi,Everything in the apartment was just as described. It was great. Thank you for being attentive.
6623339,209627567,2017-11-05,52834938,Patricia,"Terra’s place was perfect for our night stay in Albany. Parking was available, food and entertainment was nearby, and the apartment was spotless. Great choice!"
6623339,210460949,2017-11-09,153675722,Ryan,"Location was Perfect for anything Albany, walking distance to hip bars, food spots, tattoo shops, anything you want to do. The space was comfortable and had an open floor plan. We loved the coded door entry, it made for a perfect check in and check out. The balcony was great for having a smoke. Bed was comfortable. Chalk board with Wi-Fi was a kool touch. Me and my wife were very happy with the accomadations and would come back again. Loved the brownstone exterior that seems to be a remodeled police station. Great place. Good communication. Awesome location."
6623339,210894575,2017-11-11,135130532,Kristopher,93/100 this house was an amazing stay
6623339,211269374,2017-11-12,48941446,Suzanne,"The apartment was perfect for what we needed.  It was a clean, neat cozy place to rest after a concert a few miles away at the Times Union Center.  The location was convenient and available parking was a plus!"
6623339,212010247,2017-11-15,59477687,Chris,Terra's place is extremely well located and is really a charming apartment in Albany. It was very comfortable and convenient. Fully suggest staying here if in Albany or surrounding areas.
6623339,212169216,2017-11-16,1434081,Sam,Perfect location for a business trip to Albany!
6623339,212382078,2017-11-17,52702408,Sara,"Easy check-in, clear communication."

6623339,214084852,2017-11-24,150634373,Nicholas,"A truly unique building with hotel like towels, sheets, and furniture! We were able to walk to restaurants and bars easily, and really enjoyed our visit! Would stay here again if we come back."
6623339,216309097,2017-12-03,149575685,Marty,The apartment was as described. Very good location if you’re looking to be in that part of Albany. We were walking distance to the restaurant we wanted to eat at and you are within a short five minute walk to a major supermarket if you choose to make your meals in the kitchen. Very comfortable and cozy place. Offstreet parking was a plus
6623339,216592333,2017-12-04,23966291,Laura,Beautiful large space with super high cielings convenient to amenities.  I arrived after 11:30PM and the pizza joint across the street was open.  Bed linens were divine!  I'd be delighted to stay again.
6623339,216930759,2017-12-06,17737775,Claire,"My husband and I stayed at Terra's place for one night and absolutely loved it. It's an extremely stylish and spacious apartment in an awesome location.  Terra was extremely responsive and had lots of great tips for local restaurants. For the location and level of luxury the place brings, it is SUCH a better value than the hotels in the area. The bed was extremely comfortable and had the nicest, fluffiest blanket on it!<br/>Thank you, Terra!"
6623339,217977016,2017-12-10,46469527,Thom,"Cool, contemporary, open space with cozy charm. Love the historic nature of the building. Walkable to lots of coffee shops and restaurants and the beautiful Washington Park. Other reviews warned about the noisy neighborhood but that wasn’t my experience, at least not in winter with windows closed. Good communication with hosts; clear instructions for access and unit amenities. I enjoyed staying here very much!"
6623339,218915650,2017-12-15,524363,Dan,A great stay - hosts were very helpful after checking in with them.
6623339,219480078,2017-12-17,52662538,Emma,"The apartment was more beautiful and stylish in person. Amazing location in Albany, the kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need. The apartment is large and bright. Check in was flawless and having a parking space made the whole experience better. I’d definitely recommend!"
6623339,219898090,2017-12-19,35591333,Emilia,Great little space and a bit of history. Loved the convenience to local restaurants and was perfect for our one night stay to see our wedding cake maker.
6623339,220269973,2017-12-21,57018272,Casey,"Great place, in a cool old building.  Got great recommendations from Terra for local food as well!  Easy on-site parking for one vehicle. If I'm ever back in Albany, I would stay here again!"
6623339,220475033,2017-12-22,51000153,Sara,Adorable apartment. Terra was an amazing host!
6623339,220696256,2017-12-23,161956464,Zach,Great experience! Would highly recommend!
6623339,220971906,2017-12-24,34830437,Amanda,"Outstandingly clean, comfortable apartment in a convenient location right off of Lark Street. Off-street parking was also a nice bonus. We will definitely book again when we return to the area—for your money, this was head and shoulders above a hotel."
6623339,221433577,2017-12-26,2046878,Todd,Great space in prime downtown Albany location. The apartment is large with high ceilings and ample space for two people. Terra made the check in super easy and she is always a great host!
6623339,221711380,2017-12-27,7953524,Mandy,"My husband and I moved out of Albany several years ago and we were excited to visit the area again. This airbnb is a nice space in a good location in Albany (with a coveted parking spot in Center Square!), but there were a few things that could have been improved. I don't know if there were issues because we visited right after Christmas, but I feel as though a lot of details were overlooked. <br/>	<br/>Check in is at 3pm. The host had asked what our ETA was and I had let them know we were aiming for around 3pm. We showed up around 3:30pm and the unit was still being cleaned. Seeing as checkout is at 11am, I wouldn't think this would be an issue. Upon arrival, there was absolutely no toilet paper. After about 10 minutes, we were provided with one roll. There was a full load of  laundry running in the drier and the dishwasher was running as well.<br/>	 <br/>The bathroom could use some love. There was dirt of a questionable sort on the hanging hand towel. A curtain or a privacy filter would be welcomed on the bathroom window as the blinds did not completely cover it.  While in the bathroom I could clearly see into neighboring windows, meaning they could also see me! The bathroom did have nice argan oil shampoo and conditioner, but body soap was not provided so make sure to bring your own.<br/>	<br/>We would have liked to have coffee using the Keurig coffee maker, however there were no Keurig pods as advertised in one of the photos. The bottled waters were appreciated. <br/>	<br/>Other reviews commented on noise due to a nearby bar. Outside noise wasn't too much of an issue during our stay, as it was ~10 degrees out, but we could hear cars and buses outside, so I could see how noise could be an issue in the warmer months. <br/>	<br/>There is no temperature control in this unit. It was very cold when we were there and the unit stayed on the colder side. A small space heater was provided. <br/>	<br/>The bed has a memory foam mattress, was comfortable, and we slept well. The bedroom does get pretty bright in the morning, so sleeping in may not be an option for you unless you wear a sleep mask. <br/>	<br/>The living space was set up nicely and the furniture was very comfortable. <br/>	<br/>Overall, this was a good space, but better attention to detail would have made this great. Hopefully the hosts take notice and improve for their future guests."
6623339,222761497,2017-12-30,136011824,John,Great 
6623339,224879074,2018-01-04,736213,Jessica,"Terra’s place was stylish, comfortable, and within walking distance of several shops, restaurants, and Empire Plaza. Terra was also quite accommodating with letting us check in early on a very cold day."
6623339,227619599,2018-01-15,70825712,Katie,"Location gave us the ability to walk to the state museum, coffee, restaurants, shops, bars.  Spacious living area with high ceilings.  Comfy bed, couch, and blankets.  A little chilly inside near windows and the apt doesn't have temp. control as far as I know (but we were also there when it was 7 degrees...).  Would return for another stay!"
6623339,229445054,2018-01-23,25140980,Craig,It is a great place to stay. Excellent location. Close to some great restaurants and bars!
6623339,229792467,2018-01-25,50943423,Laura,The space was as described in the listing and was quite spacious. Check in/check out was a breeze. The parking spot was a huge bonus. Location was great near restaurants and night life. The bed was really comfortable. Terra was a great host. I would definitely stay again.
6623339,230220757,2018-01-27,48586396,Linda And Henry,We had a very pleasant stay
6623339,230570320,2018-01-28,29476490,Tobi,Beautifully decorated apartment. Comfortable and clean. In the heart of downtown Albany. Sad we only stayed one night. Host very responsive and helpful. Would definitely recommend this place to stay!
6623339,230911252,2018-01-29,42761597,Mary,"Great place to stay, but if noise bothers you, you wont be happy with bar next door. I slept through, but it may bother some. Really neat place. Nicely decorated, great price. I would stay again."
6623339,231759958,2018-02-02,114579156,David,"Such a great space, very comfortable and very clean. The designated off street parking was a bonus! We walked all over - restaurants, bars, shops.... this place is perfectly located. I’ll search this place out again the next time I’m staying in Albany. And the hosts were very easy and pleasant to deal with."
6623339,231934514,2018-02-03,162023381,Thomas,Fantastic place with countless bars and restaurants in walking distance.

6623339,236162020,2018-02-18,134289901,Bailey,Terra's place was amazing! A modern space in a good location. It can be a little loud at  night but that's to be expected in a big city. Would definitely recommend.
6623339,236483340,2018-02-19,55470189,Timothy,"Terra has a great place in one of my favorite locations in Albany.  They've done a great job of turning this police station into a cool loft style living complex. <br/>The parking spot was very clutch.  Having lived in the area prior, I know how much of a pain parking can be in the area."
6623339,237604787,2018-02-23,101211850,Rob,"Great communication. Accommodating.  Clean, comfortable spot.  Thank you!"
6623339,238326398,2018-02-25,23663345,Kristen,We had a great stay at Terra's apartment. It was even more beautiful than in the pictures and the bed was absolutely amazing! It's also in a really neat part of town. I enjoyed exploring the neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again.
6623339,239174141,2018-02-28,1047550,Gedas,"The place is cool, spacious, cozy and comfy, next to the restaurants. It has everything you need for a short stay. Check in was smooth and simple. Terra and Hannah were excellent hosts, responsive and willing to go extra mile in need of their guests. Thank you!"

6623339,239654285,2018-03-02,9440309,Monica,"Terra's place is wonderful - well laid-out, plenty of room, and stylishly decorated.   The cute bedroom had a big closet (not that I needed it for my overnight stay, but . . . ) and the kitchen came equipped with everything a person may need for a short or longer stay.  As others noted, noise was a bit of an issue at night but I was so tired that it didn't keep me up.  Check-in was a breeze and she was a super responsive communicator.  I would definitely recommend staying here!"
6623339,240646380,2018-03-05,399634,Deyano,In a last minute jam I reached out to Terra. Not only was she extremely responsive but also was incredibly accommodating. She made a stressful situation easy and check-in was a breeze. The space was very comfortable and had great access and parking. Couldn’t have been a better ending to a quick trip to Albany.
6623339,241057635,2018-03-07,25140980,Craig,This is a great place to stay. Close to great restaurants and bars.
6623339,243300036,2018-03-15,61720685,Candice,"This is my ""home away from home."" Terra's place is welcoming, immaculately clean and has everything I need while I'm away."
6623339,243878016,2018-03-17,4970247,Corey,"Terra's place is a top 3 Airbnb we've stayed at. The place is open and amazing and Terra even went out of her way to send me the iPad I left behind! If I ever find myself back in Albany, I hope Terra's place is available."
6623339,245246469,2018-03-21,132637007,Georgia,"I had terrific stay at Terra and Matt's place in the heart of Center Square The apartment was chic, clean,  spacious, and very comfortable with extra touches that I really liked (extra towels, well stocked kitchen). Off street parking was also a huge plus for a neighborhood with limited options. There was bit of street noise but it's what you would expect being in a city, not a problem for me at all and I am a light sleeper!  Nimble and nice, they are excellent hosts and I would  stay there again."
6623339,245749876,2018-03-23,110154535,Jodi,"We stayed one night for a show at The Egg… Perfect location, didn’t even need our car. Walked to dinner, walked to the show and walked for drinks afterwards. The place was clean and modern and had everything we needed. The noise level is definitely an issue if you’re not prepared so maybe just pack some earplugs, but otherwise awesome!"
6623339,246486088,2018-03-25,69274318,Manny,"Terra's place is amazing. It's conveniently located around bars, restaurants, etc. This is my second time staying at this location and would love to do it again!"
6623339,247446591,2018-03-28,3056559,Dan,Great place. Huge living area! Very close to Capitol and good restaurants. Terra was very accommodating and responsive.
6623339,248068004,2018-03-30,161310328,Dounie,Nice beautiful spot cool location around a lot of bars and restaurants
6623339,249060475,2018-04-01,895656,Peter,"Great hosts, great place, central location."
6623339,250043845,2018-04-03,132752825,Brian,Excellent apartment right in the middle of the city center. Very clean. The host was very responsive and gave us great local recommendations. Would highly recommend staying here to anybody who has to spend a few nights in Albany.
6623339,251239818,2018-04-07,12900082,Paul,"Great location if you want to be downtown with lots of good restaurants, bars, etc. And it was very easy getting to the event downtown that I was in Albany for. The apartment is spacious, stylish and clean. I appreciated having a couple bottles of water left in the fridge because that's always something I end up making an extra trip to pick up. I found it to be exactly as advertised, including the warning about being a vibrant urban area that may be noisy at night. So this is in no way a complaint, but for informational purposes I would say to take that seriously and that it's not just the noise of traffic and business — there were loud voices shouting outside the apartment until very early morning hours. I travel with a noisemaker so it wasn't a problem, but it's a good thing to make sure you are ok with in advance and to be prepared for. Yay for noisemakers!"
6623339,251796811,2018-04-08,7098028,Brianna,"Terra’s place was perfect for our night out in Albany! Perfect location! Immaculate apartment, comfy bed, check in was a breeze. Would definitely stay again!"
6623339,253198489,2018-04-13,15815254,Stephanie,"Terra's place was great, easy to find, and had parking which was very helpful for me. The space itself was great, nice kitchen which was well equipped to make dinner. The bed was very comfortable so I slept well.<br/>Would recommend to anyone coming to Albany!"
6623339,253939917,2018-04-15,182268276,Modesti,"Terra's place was my first Airbnb experience. Thanks to the experience, I feel confident booking lodging through Airbnb. The apartment is comfortable, well decorated and located in convenient area of town. If you're ever in Albany, I highly recommend."
6623339,254888320,2018-04-18,14604519,Leslie,Terra’s place was exactly as pictured and was situated so close to wonderful bars and shops.  The parking spot was appreciated as parking is very difficult there.  Terra was extremely communicative and made check in and out a breeze.  I highly recommend.
6623339,255743047,2018-04-21,133094039,Robert,Very clean. Spacious. Lovely high ceilings. Easy access. Close walk to fine restaurants.
6623339,256364288,2018-04-22,3076468,Maria And Kate,"Awesome apartment right in the middle of everything!  We walked everywhere all weekend, and had a delicious brunch at a cafe steps away in the morning.  Highly recommended!"
6623339,257020545,2018-04-24,25140980,Craig,I love staying here during my trips to Albany
6623339,260090366,2018-05-03,19512172,Roberto,Terra is an amazing host who goes out of her way to make sure that her guests are happy.
6623339,262042552,2018-05-07,3021260,Sarah,"Great location! Easy to walk to local restaurants and bars. A huge plus that there is a parking spot for this apartment. The apartment building is safe and secure and the apartment itself has a loft type feel. The space is nicely decorated and clean. Terra was easy to communicate with. This was a very pleasant Airbnb stay and if in Albany again, I would look to stay here again!"
6623339,262642776,2018-05-09,23966291,Laura,"Wonderful place.  Loft like with great light, deli and pizza place immediately across street.  Pressed tin ceiling with Kreuger (sp?) coffee maker and all you need to make the coffee.   I enjoyed  a stretch out on sectional and watching shadows shift on the walls at end of workday.  Plenty of space to put laptop, good supply of outlets.  Very private.  I expect to return.  Photos accurate though don't convey sense of openness."
6623339,264319091,2018-05-13,121471439,Kim,Terra’s place was perfect for my husband and I. We had business in the area and loved the neighborhood vibe very much. Lots of great restaurants in walking distance  the Historic district was very charming. We would definitely stay again!
6623339,265015752,2018-05-15,21405644,Donna,"Terra is a lovely hostess and was very attentive! The apartment is comfortable and cozy. It is also within walking distance to the hospital and Washington Park is right next-door filled with flowering bushes, trees and plants. It was so beautiful to walk through."
6623339,265880613,2018-05-18,342734,Kim,"The photos are totally accurate. Wonderful space! Tall antique ceilings, new kitchen & bath. Stylishly decorated, great ventilation. Kitchenware well-stocked (I cooked): pots & pans, utensils, baking dishes, cheese graters, etc. etc.  Across the street from a deli where I picked up some salad & delicious cornbread for like $2.<br/>LOCATION is a huge advantage: around the corner from restaurants, shops, and bars on Lark St. Yes there can be a wee bit of noise on a nice night from the outdoor patio at ""Oh bar"" but nothing that my earplugs didn't drown out. <br/>Check-in super easy with the code. Parking pass. Fantastic communication. Terra was able to let me have a late check-out at 4:00 because my flight didn't leave until 6:30 pm, which was incredibly considerate since another guest was due at 5:00.<br/>Will totally stay here again when I return to Albany."
6623339,267730120,2018-05-22,184302980,Tara,"Great space!  Having parking is great.  The apartment is spacious, great communication, and the bed and pillows are comfortable.  I look forward to return visit."
6623339,299739299,2018-07-31,72587123,Jill,A great spacious apartment right in the heart of town. We loved our stay in Terra’s place and would with out a doubt stay there again. The private parking spot helped a lot because it is a relatively busy area and side of the road parking is hard to come by. Would definitely recommend staying here. 
6623339,300621641,2018-08-02,184302980,Tara,Thia apartment is so comfortable and we'll appointed.  Clean and parking is very convenient.  Terra is a great host.  Highly recommend!
6623339,301667617,2018-08-04,116883015,Deryne,Great place in a really great location with parking included! I’d recommend this spot for sure (:
6623339,303542823,2018-08-07,3655790,Elizabeth,Some issues with communication but otherwise a lovely apartment in an ideal location. Super convenient parking. 
6623339,304421337,2018-08-09,64632062,Haley,Great space and location!! Very easy to navigate around. Exactly as advertised

6623339,314943844,2018-08-27,3700129,Amari,"Super comfortable, clean and well appointed.  Everything you could possibly want for a great stay in Albany. <br/>We walked straight down Madison Street from the apt to the Egg for an evening  concert and back home again and felt comfortable and safe in the neighborhood.  It’s a lovely spot and sure beats staying in a sterile character-less hotel ANYDAY!"
6623339,315762254,2018-08-29,98989737,Sean,"Terra's place was better than expected.  The apartment is on a somewhat busy intersection so my first assumption would be an issue with street noise, but I had no issues when trying to sleep.  The location is perfect with numerous restaurants and bars around.  There were also no issues with safety.  The entrances to the building have coded locks and the door to the apartment has 2 locks as well.  Overall, I enjoyed my time at Terra's place."
6623339,316155269,2018-08-30,23966291,Laura,"Beautiful space with lots of thoughtful touches.  Wide open feel, open floor plan.  Great place!"
6623339,318313485,2018-09-03,15877194,Leroy,"My partner and I  enjoyed a lovely and lax stay in Terra's loft which was a welcome reprieve after a long drive. She made check-in super easy for us. The parking spot was a lifesaver and the area was super convenient with several bars, restaurants, and Washington Park all within walking distance of the loft.<br/>The loft was spacious, airy and beautiful. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the french doors in the kitchen led to a fire escape that we used as a small terrace.<br/>We set up a small table and two chairs and enjoyed breakfast on a Sunny Saturday.<br/>We would definitely stay again and recommend to friends."
6623339,321588730,2018-09-10,12703592,Victor,this place is great!
6623339,323408500,2018-09-15,31135564,Judith,"This space is exactly how owner describes-lovely comfortable modern apartment - convenient to shopping, restaurants, performances, bars and clubs - parking off-street was easy and convenient.<br/>Great getaway weekend!"
6623339,326600233,2018-09-22,30725215,Natalie,"Terra's place is beautiful. Kitchen and bathroom are well-stocked and the entire apartment is very clean. The building has private parking which is very convenient. It is also close to many little bars and restaurants, as well as a large park. Proximity to the bars may make it a bit noisy at night, but not enough to affect my stay. Check-in and -out were easy and Terra was available if I needed her. About a 20 minute drive from the airport.<br/>I would highly recommend Terra's place if you are traveling to Albany!"
6623339,327364814,2018-09-23,50758771,Miguel,Perfect location. Awesome place.
6623339,328554649,2018-09-26,23966291,Laura,Great location great place!
6623339,329755509,2018-09-29,152885027,Deidra,"Terra's place was fantastic! Clean, spacious and safe! We couldn't hear any outside noise from the bedroom and there was a great outside area was a nice bonus! I would stay at Terra's again when I go back to Albany!"
6623339,330356723,2018-09-30,77171554,Stephanie,Great apartment. Super helpful host. Its in a perfect location walkable distance to everything you need. Plus theres a balcony area that was a great surprise!
6623339,333001607,2018-10-06,68643282,Stella,Terra was very nice and quick to respond to my questions. The apartment is spacious and well located. I felt very comfortable!
6623339,333675157,2018-10-07,4992107,Marie And Richard,"Great, open space (big, with 11' ceilings!) in a great location. Large sectional that calls you to lounge. Only thing that would have been nice is a full-length mirror. We had a special event to go to the evening we stayed and the small mirror above the sink was all we had :(<br/>Very comfy bed. Coffee in the morning. Worked for us!"
6623339,334182140,2018-10-08,176113201,Jacques,"overall nice place, clean, and the bed was super comfy."
6623339,334920025,2018-10-10,23966291,Laura,"This is a great place to stay in walkable area, beautiful open feel"
6623339,335554762,2018-10-12,129781813,Michelle,This place really needs a deep cleaning. All of the furniture and rugs are very stained and there is considerable water damage throughout. The window seals and shades are filthy and there are large spider webs in bathroom.  There was also a random sock in the bedroom which is gross. I didn’t feel comfortable at all in the apartment due to the uncleanliness.
6623339,336750557,2018-10-14,48088683,Corey,"Terra's apartment was a huge disappointment. While the decor is fantastic, the apartment has subpar heating and left me freezing. They provide a tiny space heater and that simply isn't adequate in a large and drafty loft like apartment. They windows are insulated with seran wrap, we found dirty Kleenex in the bedroom as well as tons of dust. We also killed many centipedes and other silverfish like bugs."
6623339,337797053,2018-10-17,13921329,Ari,"Awesome place! Super lofty, great location. Perfect for a stay in Albany."
6623339,338447381,2018-10-19,24205023,Dave,A great location and a comfortable and contemporary styled accommodation.

6623339,346191592,2018-11-07,23966291,Laura,Great place.  My fave to stay for frequent  business trips to Albany!
6623339,346681235,2018-11-09,143415353,Kate,"Terra’s apartment is giant and centrally located. I stayed here for a night as I was passing through town and it was great. There are lots of places to eat in the area. I loved the decor of the apartment. <br/>The only area for improvement I would note is that I had to reach out to Terra for check-in information. Also, I asked for restaurant recommendations and she didn’t reply. Other air bnbs I have stayed in provided this information several days in advance, which was nice."
6623339,348015579,2018-11-12,99368418,Callie,"The apartment is overall a great find. One thing to know is that the apartment is located close to a bar courtyard, so it is fairly loud at night. We stayed over a weekend so it might be quieter during the week. Matt and Terra were great hosts. We would recommend!"
6623339,351081536,2018-11-21,23966291,Laura,"This a lovely wide open space with pressed tin cielings.  I try to stay here when I am in Albany which is very often.  Very close to late night food, supermarket, CVS and other businesses."
6623339,352662085,2018-11-25,7037237,Lori,"Great place, clean and spacious"
6623339,354985758,2018-12-02,157657255,Jc,Found this place at a last minute and boy was I glad I did. It is truly incredible! Pictures do not do it justice. Super fresh and super clean. Area can get a little noisy sometimes as it is near a few local bars but it was never so much so that it became bothersome. This place is amazing too bad I only spent one night but there’s always next time! Thanks Terra!
6623339,355734789,2018-12-05,23966291,Laura,Wonderful!
6623339,357085509,2018-12-09,187697111,Brian,"Terra is alway a gracious host and her apartments are stylish, clean and located near great restaurants and stylish bars."
6623339,361783711,2018-12-24,30695267,Jeffrey,"Stay in what was once a police precinct building? Why not? Cool facade, great floor plan, modern kitchen, comfy bed, high ceilings around the corner to restaurants and bars, walking distance to museums and cultural attractions, free, safe off-street parking. Terra's place exceeded our expectations. Thank you!"

6623339,424345210,2019-03-16,142338920,Jamie,"Great location near bars, a grocery store small stores.  Apartment is in an old police building which is a pretty cool “historic element”"
6623339,425044232,2019-03-17,99900466,Bruce,Such a cute place. Not our first stay here! Always clean and great communication
6623339,425998979,2019-03-19,238785409,Taylor,"Terra’s place is about 5 minutes away from Times Union Center. It was a great place to stay for us because when we got out of our concert late and tired,  the apartment was just a few minutes drive away! The bed was comfortable and the apartment was clean. We enjoyed pizza for dinner right across the street. The neighborhood was not the most appealing but we felt safe in the apartment building. We also appreciated that there was a parking spot off the street for us. Over all, we enjoyed our one night stay and this place was just what we needed."
6623339,428228536,2019-03-24,53536318,Dan,Nice apartment just off of Lark Street in Albany.

6623339,439210206,2019-04-18,35241904,Andee,"Very beautiful, spacious apartment only a 3 block walk from Empire State Plaza.<br/>Living room has a great sectional and another comfy chair; plenty of room to relax.<br/>Modern kitchen, well equipped and attractive. Bring dishwasher soap if you want to use the dishwasher.<br/>Bed was very comfortable. Big closet with shelves and hanging space;  our large suitcase fit in a corner of it.<br/>Bathroom had good storage. <br/>Nice, new washer and dryer; bring your own laundry soap.<br/>We thought it was very nice that shampoo & conditioner,  coffee, creamer, & sugar, tissues & paper towels were provided.<br/>The HVAC is in another apartment,  so we could not control th he heat. With outside temps in the 40s, it was always chilly. I wore my coat during the day and a sweater over my pjs at night, piling extra sheets, a towel, and my shawl on the bed to stay warm.<br/>Communication wasn't great. To get the front door code on check in day and to ask about the heat, I'd get no response to email until I also texted."
6623339,444265857,2019-04-27,137864348,Lesley,"Terra’s Airbnb is super cute and in a great little location in Albany. Similar to other reviews, it is a little chilly so I’m glad I packed a sweatshirt to sleep in. Some complained of noise due to a nearby bar, but to me it was 100% bearable and in no way disturbed my sleep or overall experience. One note, the bathroom isn’t all the way finished but still was very clean and usable. Overall, I would recommend staying here and will request to stay here again if I’m ever back in Albany!"

6623339,487919638,2019-07-14,124310570,Francis,Great place and literally just a few steps from bars and restaurants.

6623339,492763897,2019-07-21,46966328,Sarah,"Great open space, we loved the apartment and it’s actually bigger than the pictures! We also appreciated all the locking systems on the outside doors, it made the building feel very secure."

6623339,526166626,2019-09-08,74361138,Ward,An appartment full of mice as dirty as hell! We left after there where mice in our appartment. Host thinks that it normal because its an old building and the weather has changed. Because we left in the afternoon no refund because she wanted to rent it to other people!!! It was to crazy for words.
6623339,528714575,2019-09-13,14816893,Nina,"Stylish apartment in a good downtown location, with washer and dryer in unit, well equipped kitchen, nice shower"
6623339,533377605,2019-09-21,61542642,Paula And Steve,Great place to stay!  Convenient to shops and restaurants.  Very clean and spacious-even has a little outdoor balcony.
6623339,534353473,2019-09-22,80279170,Jenn,"The apartment was very bright and open and welcoming. The bed was super comfy. The location couldn't have been better in terms of cafes, restaurants, and bars."
6623339,536404656,2019-09-26,212504353,Erin,"Terra's apartment is beautiful. Very centrally located with plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The parking space is a nice bonus. As other reviewers state, its proximity to nightlife can make it a bit noisy, but this was not a problem during my stay -- the area was quiet at bedtime. The building itself is very quiet. Check-in was straightforward and convenient. The space is furnished very nicely, and the bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. I highly recommend this stay and will definitely be back!"
6623339,543374430,2019-10-07,87809268,Charlisa,This space is peaceful and will help you clear your mind. I️ highly recommend this place to visitors. You won’t regret it 💜.
6623339,547106036,2019-10-14,127517312,Timber,This was by far one of my favorite Air BnB’s! Perfect location with amazing restaurants & bars in walking distance. The apartment was also super spacious & had perfect amenities. Highly recommend.

6623339,559188032,2019-11-03,18343357,Vikki,"We had a wonderful stay at Terra's place. The idea of staying in a restored police precinct from the 1800s sounds daring and exciting! The apartment is updated, clean and comfortable. Terra was responsive when I called with any questions. It is in a great location, right around the corner from Lark St. It might be a little loud  outside at night on the weekends, but that's because you're in the heart of the Village in the City. I would definitely recommend this place when visiting Albany!"
6623339,565554919,2019-11-17,5477892,Kim,Terra’s apartment was the perfect home base for my stay in Albany!
6623339,574728378,2019-12-08,24518319,Catharine,"This apartment is a great option! Very clean and close to many shops and restaurants. We stayed on a particularly cold weekend and the apartment was quite chilly but there was a space heater that we were able to use. Overall a great experience, would stay again!"
6623339,580915134,2019-12-23,64578322,Linda,It is a great location with lots of places to eat within walking distance.
6623339,583362027,2019-12-28,135410672,Darian,"The morning of our stay, Terra contacted me to say that there was a problem in the apt that needed repair and offered us the choice of staying at her inn up the street or cancelling for a full refund. We chose the inn and it was lovely. Very convenient to Lark St and right on Washington Park. We would have loved to stay in the apt but the inn worked out just fine. Thanks Terra!"
6623339,584699803,2019-12-30,159076559,Jim,"This apartment is a great space in a very cool historical building in a beautiful Albany neighborhood. You are close enough to walk or run, as we did, around fabulous architectural landmarks through cobblestone streets. A great kitchen to whip up a meal and well apportioned bath and bedroom make this loft-like apartment feel just like home! You will be very happy staying here, we were!"
6623339,587185303,2020-01-02,225438516,Natalie,Been to a good amount of air bnbs and I must say this has been one of my favorite stays. Lots of stores and restaurants around. The apartment itself was clean and very cozy to stay in. Very happy with my stay here and definitely recommend it.
6623339,600375592,2020-02-01,332095237,Brian,We had the pleasure to stay At one of Terras locations and it was absolutely beautiful. The apartment was clean and Terra was very nice and very responsive.  I highly recommend her and her properties
6623339,605443939,2020-02-14,125347139,Marc,"Great location, near everything and great restaurant or Pub.<br/>It was a little bit noisy on the streets that night (St-Valentin?), but I loved the place."
6623339,605867013,2020-02-15,6319597,Jessica,Great place! Fantastic location. Would stay again for sure.
6623339,613038937,2020-03-01,88977855,Lisa,Had a great time- the apartment was cold on arrival but Terra quickly responded and told us where we could pull out a few space heaters from and it warmed up quickly! Check in was easy and Terra was super responsive. Place was super clean and we had a great time.
6623339,615210866,2020-03-07,169242796,Gregory,Nice place in a great neighborhood.
6623339,636170903,2020-07-09,194289696,Chris,"Great place to stay. Very roomy, high ceilings give it a nice atmosphere. Check in was easy, host was always there to answer any questions. The area is great, tons of restaurants within walking distance. <br/>It was very hot outside during our stay (85°-95°) every single day and we didn't even feel that because the A/C was so comfortable inside the apartment. Would definitely stay again"
6623339,640031537,2020-07-19,158988690,Hannah,"Super adorable and spacious 1 best room. Very lofty feeling, minimal, and comfortable! Walking distance to my favorite spots downtown."
6623339,642231717,2020-07-25,47936007,Steph,"Stayed here while heading north to go hiking at a few spots in the Catskills and Lake George. The location is great—lots of cute coffee shops and beer spots to fill your time. We didn't spend much time in the actual space, but it was large and open and worked out great for what we needed."
6623339,671082074,2020-10-04,44223460,Jericho,"Amazing place! Clean, stylish, and perfect for what we were looking for!"
6623339,673536540,2020-10-11,99999161,Tina,"This light, lovely loft right off of Lark street is a real find. It is comfortably furnished and thoughtfully equipped with kitchen necessities. Because it is literally one building away from Lark Street, it is in easy walking distance to bars, food, coffee and Washington Park.<br/>We Weill be coming back to this spot."
6623339,707443139,2020-11-08,70395698,Tanoha,This spot is spectacular. A very cute spot. Everything was walking distance. Looks exactly like in the pictures. Clean and stylish. Tera responds right away about any questions.  Will most definitely stay here again.
6623339,719402333,2020-12-29,38951167,Kathy,Very stylish place. Host super helpful and nice
6623339,727157125,2021-01-27,20577415,Lindsay,"The space is very stylish and well decorated. I love the furniture and found the couch, chairs and bed to all be very comfortable. The location is extremely convenient and the off street parking is truly a god send in this neighborhood. It can be quite loud with traffic and music outside when you’re in the main living space, but I didn’t find it bothered me most of the time.<br/>It was a wonderful space to live in for an extended stay. Terra was a very sweet host who was wonderful to deal with anytime anything came up. She was always receptive, had a positive attitude and was solution oriented, which I love. Thank you!"
6623339,746180863,2021-04-05,181858543,Kathie,"This attractive open space with high tin ceilings and arched windows made for a great stay. Loved the off road parking for unloading and loading. There was some street noise but you are so centrally located and it is quieter in the bedroom. The bed mattress and linens are good. There is a Keurig coffee maker, so bring some pods."
6623339,748869399,2021-04-15,52556245,Matthew,We really enjoyed our weeklong stay at Terra's place.  The building has a lot of character and the unit is spacious with tall ceilings and lots of natural light.  The furniture is stylish and comfortable and the kitchen is well supplied.  We also appreciated the plentiful storage space and heater for cold mornings.  We also enjoyed the Lark Street coffee places and restaurants and walking around Center Square and the Capitol area neighborhood.
6623339,749891586,2021-04-18,27132912,Amy,This is a great spot. Lovely and perfect for a quick getaway
6623339,755342362,2021-05-05,387655342,Hollace,The apartment is in a cool old building in a great part of town that is good for walking.  The apartment is very nicely appointed and very clean.  The bed is especially comfortable!  Great location for walking down to the Capital area.   I recommend this place!!!
6623339,758413501,2021-05-15,11991868,Kelly,We had a great time in this apartment. Very spacious and nice - the huge sofa is great and the bed was comfortable too. Right around the corner from Lark Street with the bars and restaurants. Parking was easy in the private parking lot behind the building. Would stay here again!
6623339,759036392,2021-05-16,76026010,Richard,"Awesome spot, close to many bars and restaurants!"
6623339,760720322,2021-05-21,402310510,Finn,"Great location, clean, up-to-date appliances, and parking.<br/>No air conditioning so open some windows or be prepared to sweat it out."
6623339,761530452,2021-05-23,54062797,Karen,This apartment was perfect for our weekend stay. It was clean and spacious and within walking distance of many restaurants and bars. The parking lot is an added bonus
6623339,763403688,2021-05-28,61318947,Patrice,Great time as usual!
6623339,529657935625984648,2021-12-31,1289864,Judith,"Terra, while not the most responsive host, is in other ways a very thoughtful one. I stayed in the apartment for a month after I sold my house in between homes. The apartment was very clean, nicely appointed and I had everything I needed for my long stay in the kitchen, bath (nice water pressure, good hot water) and bedroom (comfortable mattress). I especially appreciated the in-unit washer & dryer and off-street parking! The wifi was good, once I got the correct password, and there is a smart tv in the unit, but there is no cable television so be prepared to use your streaming service for tv. The location is great for individuals & couples, but maybe not so much for families: you can walk to Washington Park and Empire Plaza and Lark Street with many good coffee cafes, restaurants and bars and the bar scene is very active all weekend. Overall, this is a lovely apartment in a convenient location for local attractions and night life. I will recommend Terra to friends!"
6623339,531170760143039964,2022-01-02,266737460,Monique,"Lovely spacious apartment, though a bit chilly in January with no visible in suite temperature control (apartment is located in a heritage building, so understandable)."
6623339,631802140685968217,2022-05-21,22718953,Ashleigh,"Extremely poor communication. Didn’t receive check in info until 30 mins after I was supposed to check in.<br/>Host didn’t reply to multiple Airbnb messages, had to contact them via email address/phone number just so I could get into the apartment.<br/>I was told ‘keep the keys on you in case the door codes change or the door locks run out of battery.’ There were no keys.<br/>I asked about the keys every day and received reassurance to say ‘yes I will drop the keys round tomorrow’. No one turned up for 9 days, and no courtesy messages to say they wouldn’t be able to make it - literally just didn’t turn up. <br/>When they eventually did show up, I only received one key for main door building and no key for apartment door because they couldn’t find it. They also said they would be in the ‘very next day’ to set up the Apple TV, no one turned up, it was still not set up when I left. <br/>Such a shame because the apartment was lovely and spacious, location was great, there was a washing machine/dryer, but communication was so poor."
6623339,638405188354663958,2022-05-30,76389970,Mollie,"Beautiful converted loft. Check in and check-out were very smooth.  Comfortable bed and place to hang out. You could hear noise from the street, but I think that's inevitable in the neighborhood, which is a great place to stay - close to many wonderful restaurants and Washington Park.  The noise didn't get in the way of my sleep. We would definitely stay here again."
6623339,668034131078292670,2022-07-10,173594548,Mariam,"Great location in Albany, clean apartment, and Terra was very responsive"
6623339,677559023110904024,2022-07-23,218665233,Crystal,"The place was lovely, just like the pics & we loved the high ceilings and lighting."
6623339,678915078475652191,2022-07-25,323477851,勤博,"The host never replied my inbox message at all.  On the day I arrived, it was very warm,  36 C outside.  I arrived early and text her whether I can check in early.  She replied ok but no message at all in the following 2 hours.  I had to wait outside.  I was here for an exam and I didn’t want to get sick.  The host was extremely not responsive.  I didn’t feel comfortable to stay there and eventually I canceled my reservation without getting refund.  IT WAS A VERY TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE."
6623339,705810692619149173,2022-08-31,4943975,Michael,A nice place in an up and coming neighborhood.
6623339,708739601944402861,2022-09-04,190422902,Abhishek,"The place is at a good location but it was not maintained as expected. There was a complete lack of cleanliness and hygiene.<br/>There is no elevator , so you will have to carry everything you bring."
6623339,711624630054869834,2022-09-08,88589139,Carolyn,Apartment in a historic building that was in a great location nearby a park. Place was exactly as described and suited my needs perfectly.
6623339,713773368165546420,2022-09-11,208946995,Raymonde,Terra’s place is in a prime location in Center Square.  Very convenient and great parking space. You won’t have to worry about parking! Everything was great besides communication; the host takes a long time to respond to request which can cause a delay in your travels.  I had to reach out to Airbnb to  contact the host in order to get a response.  So if you’re looking to have an easy check in and booking approval process this may cause a great delay for you
6623339,728194814470997385,2022-10-01,427834868,Cedric,Très bien
6623339,736269223041996022,2022-10-12,43508581,Doug & Lisa,"Terra's place was perfect!  We loved the location only 2 blocks from Washington Park, which was beautiful.  Close to lots of great restaurants and downtown.  We walked almost everywhere.  Free parking was a huge plus and there was a grocery store 1 block away for anything we needed.  Terra and Matt were great hosts!"
6623339,739168363101894887,2022-10-16,64243735,Jamie,"A really cool, no-frills apt. A few non-frills could be added, thought, such as soap in the bathroom and paper towels. The space is great, high ceilings, a big open floor-plan outside the bedroom. It's on a busy corner, with noise from a bar and passing cars, which I happen to like - I miss living in cities - but others might not. Also, if you're sensitive to smells, the apartment had a heavy smell of a spicy/sweet air freshener. We had the windows open. If the weather were colder, this review might have been more negative, as the smell was more than a little much. That all said, we did really enjoy the apartment very much, check in was smooth, shower and bed were good, and I will return to it if it's available when I come to town."
6623339,859431182358606560,2023-03-31,212432242,Kristyn,It was all around a nice stay.
6623339,860903769446473091,2023-04-02,507921414,Chinalu,"Good location in a walkable area. Nice clean apartment.<br/>Check-in was simple and straightforward. Appreciated the detailed instructions from the hosts. My only gripe is that the hosts were not as responsive as I would’ve liked. Overall I enjoyed my stay, and would book again in the future."
6623339,1028339798894558342,2023-11-19,32933996,Heath,Another great stay at one of Terra’s properties. This one has a wonderful location right on the corner of Lark and Madison. Went to dinner and a show on Lark Ave and had a great time being able to walk from the apt.
6623339,1034089437235083771,2023-11-27,14057315,Leiah,"I recently stayed at this Airbnb and want to provide constructive feedback. The host's delayed response (over 24 hours) for check-in instructions caused unnecessary stress. The property lacked essential amenities, including shampoo and hangers. While a laundry machine was available, the absence of detergent was inconvenient. Despite a ""No Pets"" policy, pet hair was present. The Keurig machine had no K-Cups, and dining chairs were unstable. Additionally, it's worth noting that there was noise from a bar's outdoor patio below the bedroom window. Improvements in host communication and addressing these issues would enhance the overall guest experience."
6623339,1043602207607527549,2023-12-10,253543105,James,"Awesome place with easy parking.  Great location and within walking distance to restaurants and local attractions.   Speedo Santa sprint took place on the Main Street right outside of the location, as well as the local chili tasting competition, while we were visiting.  Room is spacious with all of the amenities of being home and easy PIN code access to the building and room.  Awesome!"

6623339,1119687746409256136,2024-03-24,17196090,Sarah,"This is overall a nice apartment in a great location - right off Lark St. The apartment was clean and well decorated with all the amenities we needed. The private parking spot is a great perk. The host provided all the information we needed and was very responsive. However, we visited on a cold March weekend, and the apartment was very cold, even with a space heater on. Also, the bed had some sort of memory foam mattress that did not hold its shape— this may just be personal preference but my husband and I both found it uncomfortable."
6623339,1124011332551139204,2024-03-30,219755773,Matthew,Place was exactly as posted! Beautiful apartment.
6623339,1125416643443922626,2024-04-01,119307682,Anastasia,"We had a great stay here. We wish we had access to turn the heat up as it was a bit chilly in the apartment. We were told there were space heaters in the closet but it turned out it was only a cooling fan. <br/>The morning of checkout we had an incident where the cleaning crew came into the apartment while we were still sleeping. That was highly stressful and made us feel very uncomfortable. The host did apologize and handled the situation right away however, it was not a pleasant situation to deal with. <br/>The space  is great and the host was very communicative and helpful. Clean and neat and pretty cool details from the precinct."
6623339,1131193992117764592,2024-04-09,144845567,Daniel,"We had a brief but very comfortable stay here. All communication and pre check in information was very clear. We had a small issue that our host Ming had clocked and addressed before we even arrived, and went to great lengths to make it right. Not many airbnb hosts go to so much trouble, so I have to commend Ming for this one, thank you. <br/>I’d be very happy to stay here again next time we’re in Albany."

The host went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The space itself was beautifully decorated, impeccably clean, and had all the amenities we could ask for. The location was perfect, allowing us to explore the area easily. We highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking for a cozy and memorable experience."""
6623339,1150054489966786875,2024-05-05,26899919,Becky,"Large one bedroom in a unique spot. The location is centrally located towards attractions in Albany and is located on a strip with many bars and restaurants. To note, because of this location, also note that there are some people also hanging on the street. The space was very large and clean. We had some trouble with the locks to get into the building; the owner was responsive in getting the issue remedied within an hour. Overall a good value and very convenient if looking to stay in a neighborhood with a park, and a bunch of great restaurants and bars!"

The apartment was well equipped with all you need, dishes, pots and pans , small selection of spices, coffee and flavored creamers.  The location is FANTASTIC!!!  Easy walk to the amazing shops  and restaurants and bars on Lark St. We could walk to the bus station and the park. Host was communicative and responsive. We will definitely visit again!!

6623339,1192054538898835668,2024-07-02,218665233,Crystal,The location is my favorite in the Albany area & the place is sooo cozy!
6623339,1205169973090836117,2024-07-20,1437816,Sharon,Apt was just as described. Pics accurate. Lots of local info if you need. We were only there for a quick stay overnight but was a great find.
6623339,1206593192452859159,2024-07-22,89783700,Riaz,We’ve stayed at Terra’s airbnbs multiple times. Always a good time.
6623339,1207999478536589149,2024-07-24,3625232,Georgie,"Comfortable and clean. In a great area, walkable to everything and good restaurants. Parking was a great benefit too."
6623339,1208727291853019346,2024-07-25,181198514,Renee',"Great location, nice decor, spacious for a  one bedroom condo with parking space included. The condo was very secure for a city dwelling located in downtown Albany, NY."
6623339,1210943721350455486,2024-07-28,180600242,Jason,The apartment was beautiful and very clean. Definitely one of the nicer airbnb’s I’ve stayed at. It was easy to find parking as well. Thanks for an amazing stay!
6623339,1213141878028990093,2024-07-31,581752723,Ziqi,"I came to Albany for the bar exam and spend two nights in Terra's house. It's totally out of my surprise because it's big, clean, close to everything I need. Staffs are very helpful and they pick up the phone imediately. I really love the apartment becasue I found it was a police station before. Will look for a similar place the next time to move."
8035768,45450711,2015-09-02,42938417,Shona,"John and Debbie made us all incredibly welcome. They are warm, sociable and engaging. The house is fabulous - an authentic,  beautifully and tastefully renovated historic property. Beds were comfortable, amazing shower and great breakfast. We loved our stay and our teenage daughter (who was even provided with her own private tub of ice cream in her room) really did not want to leave!!"
8035768,45647186,2015-09-04,40951900,Adriel,This room was spotless and well stocked. It is a large space with a very clean and comfortable bed and beautiful arrangements. John is particularly accommodating and easy to work with. I highly recommend him and if you ever have the pleasure of staying here you will not regret it. 
8035768,45916739,2015-09-06,8130967,Gabrielle,"John and Deb went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to accommodate our travel schedule. The house was immaculate and the room was large and luxurious. There was an in-room air conditioner and refrigerator and the bed was super comfy. There were snacks and coffee and off-street parking. It had a professional BnB feel. Also, they have an adorable dog :)"
8035768,46853746,2015-09-13,44005776,Alan,We had a great stay!  John and Deb were wonderful and made us feel right at home. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
8035768,47331155,2015-09-17,459545,Tiffany,"Loved my first visit to Albany. John and Deb were so kind and accommodating - they stayed up for my late night flight arrival, set up a mobile-controlled lock system, and left me coffee in the morning. Their house is beautiful --- from the spotless kitchen to the enormous, luxurious bedrooms, and delightful tree-lined street. Bakery across the street has excellent bagels. Would definitely stay again."
8035768,51079721,2015-10-17,3113886,Anh-Tai,"John's house was indeed beautiful. My wife and I (and our 2 dogs) felt really comfortable while away from home. The room was huge, the bed was superb, the bathroom incredible. They even prepared some breakfast for us; a kind gesture!<br/>Little things that will enhance the experience:<br/>1) A desk that we can work on, in case you are traveling for business like myself<br/>2) A trash can in our bedroom<br/>3) A spare key (hardware) in the event technology and communication can't link us up :-)<br/>Otherwise, you guys get an A- in terms of overall Customer Experience. Thanks!!"
8035768,51740990,2015-10-24,9644699,Ange,"Beautiful victorian house that is approx 35 minutes walk from central Albany. The host and his partner were very friendly and always enquired if we needed anything in addition to what we had. They provided fresh coffee each morning. The beds are beyond comfy and I slept deeply whilst there.
<br/>
<br/>Things to note, we had originally thought we were going to be renting the full house and not just rooms, i believe this issue has now been cleared up. So the listing is for one or two rooms and your hosts live in the house but on a different floor. This is fine as the space at the top is where the rooms are so private to you and the hosts have their own living room on the middle floor.  There was an issue with one of the toilets draining properly which wasn't nice to deal with but was sorted when the hosts came home. The locks are electronic and require your phone, i found this cumbersome and unnecessary but i'm aware that the host is looking to change this too. Therefore, feedback is always acted upon which is refreshing.
<br/>
<br/>Overall, i enjoyed my airbnb experience here.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks
<br/>
<br/>Ange"
8035768,52004728,2015-10-25,44274689,John Øystein,"Beautiful house, around 30-35 min walking distance from downtown Albany. John and Debbie were very welcoming. They made us feel at home, with fresh coffee every morning. Cute dog too. Nice, soft beds, beautiful bathroom and good Entertainment/wifi. There was a misunderstanding when we arrived, as we thought we had booked the entire house, not just a single room. I guess we hadn't looked thoroughly at the print, and more at the pictures. But John sorted this out by giving us a discount on the second room we needed for our stay. There is a Family run restaurant right across the street which serves good, authentic vietnamese food. Nice bagels and coffee at the Hudson river coffee house, two blocks away. "
8035768,53445289,2015-11-08,11692691,Leigha,"John's place was extremely cozy and had more than everything we needed. We just stopped for a quick one-night stay. He was very accommodating, and the house is beautiful! We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Albany. "
8035768,54828070,2015-11-23,32528832,Stephen,"This was our first Airbnb experience and John was a great host. He was helpful and made us feel at home immediately. His home is beautiful and the room he offered us was very cozy. The listing was close to a main road, parks, and cafes. If we visit Albany again, his place would be our primary choice. Very grateful for John and his hospitality."
8035768,54953576,2015-11-25,49260146,Bhanu,"I had great experience at John's place. House was very clean,  private parking space  and all modern amenities. Thank you!"
8035768,55128118,2015-11-28,794153,Jared,"John was a great and welcoming host. His house is beautiful and warm, and while he gave us a lot of space during our stay we enjoyed the conversations we had with him. Rascal was also an added bonus. Would happily stay again next time I'm in the area."
8035768,55942235,2015-12-07,2219255,Natalie,"Just want to say that this is one of the most beautiful homes on airbnb! John is a wonderful man who is very helpful and courteous and accomodating. We stayed here for our daughter's University graduation and hosted a dinner party in our daughter's honor.
<br/>We cannot Thank You enough John!"
8035768,56224233,2015-12-10,12223688,欣潼 Gillian,"John's place is in a very nice neighborhood. It is close to anywhere. I enjoy my stay there very much. The bedroom has everything in there, and the mattress is so comfy helping me recover from fatigue. Also John would like to share his victorian style kitchen and living room with a beautiful christmas tree.Everything is neat and perfect. And personally, I am a dog lover. John has a cute cute puppy. He generously left Rascal as a company and Rascal and I had great time together. I highly recommend John's place to others looking for a comfy and cozy place."
8035768,60281795,2016-01-21,7034743,Maeva,"Wonderful house, really nice, thoughtful and welcoming hosts. The rooms are just as described in the pictures, very spacious, comfortable and quiet. We had a floor to ourselves and John was very flexible on checking in and checking out times. We couldn't have wished for better accommodation."
8035768,61928669,2016-02-09,24030902,Brad,"Listing was completely accurate. Great house, warm and welcoming owner. John showed us around the place, chatted us up, tried to help us get a taxi into downtown. Above and beyond. 
<br/>
<br/>John has the bathroom set up like a spa, and the kitchen is done up like a B &B. Coffee in the morning, coffee cups set out with spoons. Nice touch. 
<br/>
<br/>Walkable from downtown (we walked back from  a show at Times Union...in the snow...uphill )  but probably not something you want to plan on. 
<br/>
<br/>Great little neighborhood. Wish Duke's had been open, would have gotten a beard trim. Heard great things. 
<br/>
<br/>If you need a place with FAR more value than you would expect at the price - and a gracious host as well - check this place out. "
8035768,63620643,2016-02-25,10886946,Subhashree,"My partner and I stayed at John's for a week and had the best time. John was very kind and friendly. He made us feel so comfortable and at home. The house was kept so well and clean. He has a lovely and an adorable poodle (Rascal) and you cannot resist falling in love with him. Coming from a person who is not much of a dog lover, you can take my word on it.  By the time we left John's, he has come to become more of a family now. It will be always my first choice to go to John's every time I visit Albany. <br/>"
8035768,69484122,2016-04-11,59542843,Tom,"I spent 3 weeks at Johns place, he is a warm and friendly guy, the room was very nice, as was the rest of the house! The house is very convenient to the downtown area, walking distance in most cases. Thx again John for your hospitality!!! See you again!"
8035768,70308036,2016-04-17,22435293,Marybeth,"I came to Albany to enjoy a weekend with my daughter, a student at Siena College. I needed a place that would allow our dog to stay over, and I've always loved big beautiful Victorian homes… So John's listing caught my eye. He preapproved our stay with our dog which was great!  The rooms that he rents are on the third floor, they're very well appointed.  The shared bathroom is very nicely done. Guests are able to use the amenities on the main floor of the home too.  All in all, it was a good experience. John has great security in the house, and there is parking in the back of the house.  It's a very convenient spot.<br/>I recommend this property!<br/>Marybeth <br/>"
8035768,74427463,2016-05-15,5590442,Kelsey,"Everything about our stay was convenient and efficient, and the rooms are very comfortable. Note that the larger room is on a busy road."
8035768,76940432,2016-05-29,54097161,Jacob,"John was a great host! This was our first air bnb stay and he helped us feel comfortable and welcome. The house was in a great location, close to the park and lots of activities, and the amenities inside were superb. I would not hesitate to recommend a stay."
8035768,77623101,2016-06-02,50134009,Medet,Beatifull dream house  everything is clean and nice .<br/>John he is very polite gentlemen he help us to find good restaurants right next to the Washington Park very similar to Central Park if I will come back to Albany again I will definitely visit John house again .
8035768,78027181,2016-06-05,74371423,Dick,Everything was updated - beautiful inside. Host was very accommodating. 
8035768,86332593,2016-07-16,29130540,Gail,"We stopped in Albany for one night on our way to VT. John was there when we arrived and gave us a tour of the house, showed us our room and generally made us feel at home. The room was spacious and the king bed very comfortable. The bathroom was large with a great rainfall shower. Towels were plentiful and gloriously thick. John also gave us excellent restaurant recommendations for dinner. And introduced us to Rascal the canine host. "
8035768,92668627,2016-08-09,44457409,John,Great tour and demo of the gadgets.
8035768,112031456,2016-11-03,66209549,Sarah And Clayton,"Very cool blend of a historic house and modern renovation. Clean and in a great location, walking distance from Lark St. John was a splendid host and has a very fine selection of movies"
8035768,113693524,2016-11-13,101434723,Michael,"John ist ein sehr guter Gastgeber gewesen. In der Unterkunft ist alles wie beschrieben. Er war sehr bemüht und alles war gut. In der Umgebung hat man alle Möglichkeiten um Essen zu gehen. Man findet auch Kneipen, die alle zu Fuß erreichbar sind. Ich würde jederzeit wieder hier übernachten.
<br/>Danke John"
8035768,120739729,2016-12-11,29102454,André,"John's Victorian is unique and in the center of everything, yet remarkably quiet. John was pleasant and very helpful."
8035768,121036843,2016-12-13,100362895,Timothy,Very unique house; host has done an amazing job renovating the place with antique and modern touches. A very close location for people needing to go to Albany Medical Center. Highly recommended.
8035768,127474106,2017-01-18,81332720,Marilyn,JOHN WAS VERY PLEASANT AND EASY TO APPROACH AND VERY ACCOMADATING. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PLACE WAS ACCURATE. REALLY LIKED THE ACCESSABILITY TO MOVIES. ROOM WAS NICE AND PRIVATE.WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. EASY ACCESS TO THE CITY.
8035768,131086142,2017-02-10,110304885,Jim,"John's house rocks. Fabulous home, private, quiet and comfortable.  Off street parking too."
8035768,133438667,2017-02-22,92928,Alan,Great place! John was super friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. Thanks again for hosting us!
8035768,137152284,2017-03-13,2201411,Simon,John's place is a good spot if you don't need to be in the heart of downtown Albany but within easy reach of the city in a safe and convenient neighbourhood - one of the city's best restaurants is a quick walk away and there are good cafes nearby too. The front room is large and comfortable but you will get some noise from main street traffic. I didn't see much of John - which was fine - and when I did he was pleasant to interact with. Happy to recommend.
8035768,141912609,2017-04-05,3701748,Bill,"It's a great building, and  good location. It will be a great place to stay when some rough edges are smoothed out."
8035768,153649146,2017-05-21,17270539,Vincent,John was most hospitable.  He welcomed us with a full tour of the gorgeous Victorian Home and made us feel right at home.  If we are ever back in the area we will surely visit again!
8035768,174969506,2017-07-27,6422838,Reagan,"John's place was wonderful! The room was spacious and clean, and the location of the house was great. He was very responsive, and checking in and out was a breeze. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in the Albany area."
8035768,273591719,2018-06-06,55029254,Leland,John was very friendly and accommodating. His house is beautiful and the space he has set up for airbnb guests is great.
8035768,297851737,2018-07-28,366452,Stuart,I was at John’s for a week and had a great stay! Everything I needed for a comfortable time in Albany. I was taking an exam close by. Really enjoyed how easy John made the check-in process and the electronic key pads were perfect - never used the key once. His home was perfect and loved how close it was to the park - I went everyday! Thank you for your hospitality and making sure I was always 100% happy. 
8035768,339407926,2018-10-21,45938401,Heran,It is really an amazing place. John is very thoughtful. The location is great for visiting the city. The decoration in the house is great!
8035768,343132037,2018-10-30,80814986,Christine,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights in one of two rented out rooms on the 3rd floor of John's home.<br/>The room was facing the front of the house and was quite spacious.  There were 3 windows towards the front of the house and one window toward the side of the house. We had a desk and folding chair and a king sized bed.<br/>The floor was covered by tight woven carpet that seemed to have a lot of underpadding. There was a newer flat screen tv in front of the one window at the foot of the bed in a recessed alcove.<br/>There was a small fridge and microwave, but no coffee maker or cups or cutlery. <br/>There was also an air-conditioning unit in the room that wasn't being used anymore and wasn't put away.<br/>There were two closets but they were so full of stuff we couldn't use them for our clothes. The tv was sitting on a set of drawers which we could have used, but we wanted to hang our dress shirt and smart clothing, not lie them down in a drawer.<br/>The sheets and blankets were serviceable and the pillows were fluffy.<br/>The power bar had spots to plug in USB cables which was handy.<br/>Only one of the two bedside lamps were plugged in and the one that wasn't was likely due to the near impossible acrobatics required to plug it in behind the big bed.<br/>There was a good desk and folding chair on the side of the bed by the windows.<br/>The bathroom was shared with the other guests.<br/>This was a bit of a challenge due to their lengthy bedtime shower routine. <br/>Thankfully, if the bathroom need was urgent, there was a bathroom down on the main floor by the back door, if there was a need. <br/>We've suggested they splurge on 2ply toilet paper, single ply is just ... unpleasant.  <br/>Also, since it's a shared washroom, having our own hand towels and face cloths would be great. The big puffy bathsheets provided felt very luxurious. <br/>Appreciated the bath products provided (shampoo, conditioner, bodywash  face wash )<br/>I'm not a fan of rainshower showerheads, but this one seemed to have decent pressure and the water was hot.<br/>John lives on the second floor and the first floor seems to be in disuse, other than the back door and kitchen. The front door is not accessible and has months or years worth of mail piled high in the front hall that can be seen from the inside through a glass door.<br/>The front sitting room looks like it could be a museum display for how often it looks like it gets used.<br/>There's an area that could be a dining area but was packed full of what seemed to be renovation stuff or just being used as storage.<br/>The kitchen looked like everything that might normally be in a cupboard was on the counter, including more mail.<br/>The place was generally quiet with the exception of an inconsiderate motorcycle reving his bike in the wee hours scaring me awake. <br/>There were also numerous emergency vehicles sirens going on in the street below. Otherwise,  a very quiet stay.<br/>We were greeted by John, he showed us how to use the keyless entry and showed us our room.<br/>That was the last we saw of him.<br/>The parking area looked recently redone and was lovely. There were security cameras and lights out the back which made us fell safe.<br/>Ruby's asian fusion near by was very good food and decently priced.<br/>Overall, the place was reasonable. Could have used a few added touches, such as closet space, two ply toilet paper, personal hand towels and face cloths, perhaps a cursory daily cleaning of the bathroom, two working lamps, but overall, was a comfortable stay."
8035768,417506709,2019-02-27,38286738,Leonardo,Great place to stay in Albany!! Great location. Place is really comfortable and the host really accommodating
8035768,497390014,2019-07-28,224829549,Sumair,"Beautiful and comfortable, you won’t be disappointed."
8035768,500070888,2019-08-01,190284611,Jack,"John's place is one of the best in the area in my opinion, especially for the price. It's in a perfect location near great food, Washington Park, and of course the Lark Street corridor. John's house shows no signs of its age as he recently renovated the whole place - it is a really cool historic home. My unit had everything I needed as well. Will definitely look to book this spot again the next time I'm in town."
8035768,535968195,2019-09-25,2697430,Carlos,"John's place was great. Great rooms, amazing bathroom, refrigerator and microwave in the room, a lot of privacy, amazing check-in and key system, good parking, good location. I would definitely stay there again."
8035768,551619428,2019-10-20,264913434,Sarah,The place was very clean. The host is extremely nice about check in and check out and very accommodating.
8035768,555460797,2019-10-27,3252131,Amanda,"Super easy check in process, clean space, and good location!"
8035768,572381680,2019-12-02,304747983,Gilbert,"Just amazing. I was a guest for over a month and I 100% recommend. The room was beautiful and well kept with all the amenities of home. Truly felt like home away from home. John and Brittany are very nice and attentive. Could not have asked for better hosts. Location is perfect and not too far from anything. If you're looking for the best airbnb in Albany, you found it. STAY HERE!!!!"

8035768,1055170811472394624,2023-12-26,446202361,Pamela,Lots of safety features! Parking was great. <br/>John met us at the house and showed us ask the fun Tips for the house. Feels like you are at a family members home! Comfortable bed. <br/>Close to hospital!
8035768,1057351086762970379,2023-12-29,446202361,Pamela,The house is in downtown Albany and John has set up a lot of great safety features. Walkable park is close.
8035768,1079118475063154141,2024-01-28,14740616,Seth,"John was very responsive and easy to communicate with. He was attentive to our requests and was committed to making our stay go well. His home is as described... a beautiful old house with lovely bones. We enjoyed our stay. Thank you, John!"
8035784,51039293,2015-10-17,7805262,Lee,"John was very accommodating to us despite our arriving very late at night.  The gorgeous historic house has been tastefully remodeled and was remarkably warm and quiet.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom spacious and clean.  One concern would be for those who are unable to climb stairs (the room is located on the 3rd floor).  There was a light breakfast awaiting us on in the morning which we did not expect.  
<br/>
<br/>John uses a security system that requires guests to download an app on a smartphone.  It was/is cool technology for those who have smartphones and are comfortable using them. 
<br/>
<br/>Ample parking in the back, and conveniently located to many places.
<br/>"
8035784,61954499,2016-02-09,51755280,Martijn,"Although we didn't have a chance to meet each other those two days, John was of great and accurate help during our contact via mail/sms. The stay was comfortable in the comfortable bedroom and spacious bathroom. John prepared the coffee in the morning. We felt really at home. "
8035784,63621800,2016-02-25,18083254,Brid,"Absolutely first class experience from start to finish. The house was beautiful; bed was luxurious and comfortable, the room was bright and had everything I could need; bathroom was like a spa.  John was extremely flexible with the use of the rest of the house, which made me feel utterly at home.  The house itself is beautiful, and for those with cars there is ample off street parking.  It is a great location; close to a fanastic bakery across the street (Bread and Honey) for bagels, a Pricechopper for groceries, liquor store, restaurants and busses or (weather permitting) a half hour stroll into downtown.  I couldn't have wished for kinder or warm than hosts in John and Debbie.   We had coffee made for us in the morning, and had great conversations throughout.   John asked from the start to let him know if there was anything I else I could need to let him know - not only were requests promptly accommodated, but John and Debbie went above and beyond what was required to ensure that both myself and the other guest had all the support we could need to relieve any stress associated with taking the New York Bar exam which was hugely appreciated by us.  I didn't want to leave, and the whole experience was such that even though I was in Albany for a challenging exam, with all the stress that implies, I have come away renewed and feeling like I have had a holiday.  Rascal (the furry friend) was an added bonus - we borrowed him for lots of cuddles!! This was  my first AirBnB reservation and I doubt that any further bookings could surpass the standard  of this experience.  I can't thank them enough!"
8035784,64659447,2016-03-06,59372847,Hilite,I had a lovely stay. Very clean and convenient to the college I had a conference in. Very gracious host. 
8035784,68183550,2016-04-02,63409489,Matt,"John's home was great, his access to the home was cutting edge. His information was very helpful."
8035784,76816509,2016-05-29,18924732,Michael,"John was very welcoming and his home was comfortably ready for my arrival.  
<br/>John uses some great technology to provide access to his home thus making it very convenient.
<br/>I would highly recommend if you are staying in Albany."
8035784,77738827,2016-06-03,22326492,Kate,"We had a very good stay at John's place. The house was very nice - true to the pictures - and the bedroom was comfortable. We really appreciated having our own TV, microwave, and mini-fridge! It was also nice to have our own air conditioner so that we could control the temperature in the room. The bathroom is spacious and very nicely done. 
<br/>
<br/>We would've liked to have more communication from John - he was out of town when we arrived, which was fine, it's just something that would've been good to know ahead of time. We were also surprised that he didn't let us know that somebody was going to be staying in the other room starting mid-way through our stay, since there's a shared bathroom - again, not a big deal, but a heads up would've been appreciated! John was very responsive to texts, though, which was great. I texted with a question about where to park right before we arrived and he responded to this and my follow up questions right away, even though we got in quite late. And when we did finally meet in person, John was really nice, and asked us if we needed anything. We were very busy during our visit so we didn't see him much, but I definitely felt like I could ask for anything we needed and he would be helpful and responsive. 
<br/>
<br/>We had a couple of minor issues with the cleanliness - the trash cans in the bedroom and bathroom hadn't been emptied and the bathroom still had used towels hung up (and one on the floor) when we arrived. While the place otherwise felt pretty clean, we did worry that it hadn't been thoroughly cleaned from the last guests.
<br/>
<br/>"
8035784,79092283,2016-06-11,75479306,Jaeju,"Delightful French Victorian was perfect for my trip.  This is first time I have ever stayed at a B&B (Air or otherwise) and my experience is positive and I will use Air B&B again.  John is just right as a host.  I saw him when I was checking in and I have not run into John  or anyone else while I stayed there for 3 nights, which was great for me."
8035784,136879234,2017-03-12,57458687,Dawn,"It was nice to meet John.  He was available when called.  The house is a warm and welcoming Victorian.  My room had everything I needed, great sunlight, and room darkening shades.  Another guest was in the room across the hall and we did not have any trouble sharing the bathroom.  The rooms are separated by a large landing on the third floor.  I felt safe and found the best breakfast spot at Madison Cafe - it's worth the wait."
8035784,140924044,2017-04-01,56533318,Kelsea,Location was very central to restaurants and the concert we were going to!

9005989,96601680,2016-08-23,28071533,Scott,"Great place in a great neighborhood!  Sue was very fast to respond to questions.  I cooked most of my meals in the kitchen, and when I needed an extra pot, Sue provided one.  If you are planning to cook, you might want to make sure the kitchen is equipped with what you need before you come.  The bed is located in the front of the house, street level, but there is no traffic noise. Very quiet and wonderful!"

9005989,98762910,2016-09-01,12208099,Simen,"The place had a very distinctive smell of cat piss. It was not overwhelming but noticable. The owner sweared there had never been a cat in the apartment, but the sticker on the front door says otherwise. She blamed the smell on the previous tenant cooking onions. Onions don't smell of catpiss. I love onions and know exactly how they smell.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is in a basement and it was only possible to open one window, which was a problem because of the previous tenant - the cat.
<br/>
<br/>The shower smelled of mold.
<br/>
<br/>Other then owner being disingenuous and the smells the place was good. Nice decor etc."

Check in and check out we're super easy and she was even flexible on our check our time as we needed to leave a bit later than 11am. It was a cozy place, perfect for two people, and you can't beat the location for the price, especially because she allows dogs. The only downside was it was quite chilly as it is in the basement. She did turn the heat up for us and provided extra blankets, but we were still a bit cold the next day."
9005989,133584229,2017-02-23,61996453,YooJin,"GREAT PLACE FOR BAR EXAM TAKERS. (in Feb & July)<br/>Sue's place is a perfect place to stay if you are taking the bar exam. Its really close to the exam site. Thankfully the weather was amazing while my stay so it wasn't cold as what other people had previously said in the review. But downside was kids running (upstairs). I didn't really mind because I was listening to music with my earphones throughout, but if you are looking for a quiet place to stay, not the best place.<br/>There is no parking but there are many public parking around the area.

9005989,152651874,2017-05-17,19512172,Roberto,Perfect listing for travel or a vacation.  Gordon and Sue's listing is in the perfect location as it is a short walk from the capital and also right off Lark St.  Simply an amazing listing I would advice other host to stay.  
9005989,153081793,2017-05-19,55679242,Anne,Appartement spacieux propre et confortable. Centre ville accessible à pied ce qui est très appréciable. Appartement situé en demi sous -sol ce qui s'est avéré très intéressant par temps de canicule.
9005989,154048001,2017-05-22,128298522,Marie-Claude,"Great place, very quiet and clean! "
9005989,154442986,2017-05-24,88787717,Emily,"This place is great. Exactly as advertised, clean, and in a perfect location. "
9005989,154634832,2017-05-25,24428075,Andrea,"Sue & Gordon's place was perfect for our 1 night stay in Albany. It looked just like the pictures! We appreciated the shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom. <br/>Sue was super responsive with any questions I had. <br/>Location is walking distance to restaurants, a park & the short driving distance to the capital building! <br/>Thanks again Sue & Gordon!!"
9005989,156480018,2017-05-30,40622513,Cozette,Really a great place to stay in Albany. Close to everything and in a quiet neighborhood perfect for enjoying a relaxing weekend. Gordon and Sue's place will not disappoint. Home away from home. They are awesome hosts!
9005989,157106185,2017-06-02,82513654,Reid,"Pros: You can't beat the location. Right in the heart of Central Square and next to Washington Park. My stay was primarily for business and I felt I didn't quite take full advantage of the location. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. The host was very accommodating and answered all questions promptly. I thought parking was going to be difficult but it really wasn't that bad at all.<br/>Cons: I had to dock a star because there wasn't hot water for one morning. It was fixed by the evening, but I wasn't able to take a shower that morning. Not much else was notably poor with the experience.<br/>Overall I would recommend the room to others, and would consider staying again. Personally, I feel maybe it would be better suited for someone staying for pleasure rather than business, as you would be able to better take advantage of the prime location."
9005989,158062812,2017-06-05,107290723,Sean,Right in the heart of Albany!

9005989,159998422,2017-06-12,54684812,Sara,My boyfriend and I stayed in Gordon & Sue's home for a family wedding. It was the perfect location with lots of food and shops within walking distance.

9005989,170837114,2017-07-16,109883064,Ben,Well located basement-apartment in the heart of Albany. Sue is an extremely responsive host and it was nice to be able to receive quick feedback and communication when needed. Our only gripe was a small cleanliness matter (which was quickly resolved). Overall a great trip with a lovely place to lay our heads at the end of the day.
9005989,174072368,2017-07-24,92204118,Patty,"Coming from California, I had never seen a basement apartment. I really liked it. It was perfect for the 3 of us, mom, dad and 21yr old son, travelling through. Clean, neat and comfortable. We would definitely stay there again. "

9005989,176245056,2017-07-30,74326737,Maura,"Cute, relatively cheap apartment in a fun neighborhood with almost no natural light or air flow. Owners supplied exactly 2 cups for drinking cold drinks, 2 mugs for coffee/tea, 2 bath and 1 hand towel--so it is pretty bear bones."

9005989,180185883,2017-08-09,34371287,Kamal,"The basement apartment was clean and completely as the writeup describes. Our host was excellent to deal with.  The apartment was stocked  and ready for our arrival.  We did find it a bit damp and musty but turning the air conditioning on seemed to improve it a bit.   We didnt find any restaurants in the area that we wanted to eat at but we only stayed one night so we didnt get a chance to explore further than the immediate area. Although parking onsite isnt available, we did easily find parking up in the park area close by."
9005989,182273278,2017-08-14,3221237,William A,"Thanks for allowing us to use your beautifully adorned apartment.  The place was a lot bigger than expected and we loved the décor, the layout, the kitchen, bathroom and particularly the shampoos/conditioners and body wash left for our use.  It was an effortless self check-in and Sue was great in providing recommendations to us for a nice dinner out.  The location was superb and the street parking right outside the unit was very convenient.  Would definitely stay here again and would not hesitate to recommend Sue's place to others!  Thanks again."
9005989,183195260,2017-08-16,20666790,Erin,"This is such a cute little apartment in a fantastic location. Less than a block to beautiful Washington Park and Lark Street.

We would definitely stay here again!"

9005989,192046065,2017-09-09,1779810,Daniel,"The apartment was very neat and clean and much more spacious than it appeared in the photos. It was located right next to Lark Street which is home to the ""Village within the city"" of Albany. There were tons of restaurants and shops closeby, and everyone around was very friendly. People passing us by on the street said ""hello"" which shows you what type of neighborhood to expect."
9005989,194040755,2017-09-15,27179606,Lily,"Great spot in my favorite location in Albany. Private, quiet basement apartment that is in a beautiful sandstone rowhouse."
9005989,194813445,2017-09-17,62178994,Kristin,"Gordon and Sue were great hosts! My boyfriend and I were in Albany for a jiu jitsu tournament at the Armory. The apartment is within walking distance to the armory and is just around the corner from tons of great restaurants. We didn't have any issue finding street parking on a Saturday morning. The apartment was clean, well decorated, and comfortable. I highly recommend staying here!"

Literally right next to lark street and park... couldn't have been a better location. Even when on street parking seemed crowded we found a spot only like a block away."
9005989,201066241,2017-10-07,65672362,Bo,I wouldn't recommend this place. I left within 10 minutes of being here. There were fruit flies in the kitchen bathroom area. My asthma started acting up.  There was a moldy odor.  No dehumidifier for a basement apartment.
9005989,201976848,2017-10-09,37842504,Josh,"Great little basement apartment in a location central to Albany. On street parking was easy, within walking distance of lots of shops. Stayed here for the local marathon and would again!"

The apartment itself was effortlessly chic, modern, and cozy - absolutely loved the fireplace! Joshua & Sue made it easy to check-in & out, 10 out of 10 would recommend."
9005989,203260281,2017-10-14,32591888,Mo,Very clean. Josh and Sue were very quick to respond and very helpful. This place is close to bars and restaurants.

9005989,207173890,2017-10-28,47294280,Kevin,Joshua and Sue's place was just fitting for my 2 friends and myself. Sue was friendly and offered tips on local night life activities. The location is great to walk into downtown or enjoy a bite or drink at the many restaurants near by Lark St. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to visit Albany in the future.

9005989,211644511,2017-11-13,19109026,Lisa,Josh and Sue's place was very clean and quite comfortable.  They were very quick to respond to us.  We appreciate the very convenient location and the super comfortable bed.  It was a bit smaller than we expected but fine for a place to sleep.  It has a full sized kitchen which we found helpful to prepare food for the next leg of our trip.
9005989,211983725,2017-11-15,57127182,Kelly,Very cute little space. Comfy bed. Great location. Didn't get to meet the hosts but they were communicative.

9005989,213716129,2017-11-22,107498762,Isaak,This residence is possibly excellent for any couple or single person that could look for a place to stay either for only a night or a whole week. It is located in downtown/surburban Albany where you're not far from a park for a quiet day or a bar/night location for a more lively activity. Overall it is a residential where it is quiet.
9005989,214320845,2017-11-25,32072185,Rachel,"The space is spacious, well decorated and very inviting. A wonderful stay, with a park nearby to walk the dogs at"

9005989,218013466,2017-12-10,113074457,Jocelyn,"We found the place to be spacious and the kitchen had all the amenities.  We were in Albany for a show at the Palace theater and it was a nice 15 minute walk from there.  Also right around the corner from their place were 2 great restaurants,  Tapasia (vegan options) and Berben & Wolff (vegan).  It was a snowy weekend and the city was beautiful! Next time we are in town we would stay there again.  We didn't bring pets or kids but it would be totally doable.  There was even a pack and play in the closet."
9005989,218430257,2017-12-12,95685176,Alex,The space was great and very welcoming. It was much bigger than I expected for a basement apartment. Communication with the host was quick and our stay was very enjoyable.
9005989,219413104,2017-12-17,34645893,Jane,"Easy location, though parking was a challenge in a Friday night. You can walk to plenty. Space was private and easy to check in to. Hosts were really accommodating and flexible to a couple of last minute request for check in and check out."

9005989,227396642,2018-01-14,5244162,Linda,Very convenient location on Lark Street. Lots of nice restaurants and coffee shops and close to downtown.
9005989,229026561,2018-01-21,167331662,Jhanae,If you want something that is accessible and has modern yet classic qualities then Josh and Sue's place will make a great fit for you. The photos posted are indeed as advertised and the place came with the perfect amount of amenities (body wash and shampoo goals). My only complaint is the faint basement smell and the fairly cold rooms and shower. Overall I was pleased with our stay.
9005989,229424136,2018-01-23,135436600,Melina,Sue was very accommodating and flexible with our check in time. Thank you for let us stay in your home. Melina
9005989,230655411,2018-01-28,127268212,Linsey,Josh and Sue are wonderful hosts!! Their communication and assistance were expedient and accommodating.  Their space is modern and very cute and was perfect for my husband and I for a long weekend stay. There did seem to be about a ten minute limit on hot water during showers - certainly not a deal breaker but something to consider if you have multiple guests. The location is great! We had a convention at the Empire State Plaza and they were only about 3 blocks away! Overall our stay was great and I would recommend Josh and Sue's place!
9005989,231300360,2018-01-31,75637270,Amina,"The location is great. Close to restaurants and shops, just a few minutes of walking. Close to downtown. Hosts are great."

9005989,232356028,2018-02-04,68741958,Lisa,Great location- we were able to walk 1 mile back from Times Union center. Apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. We were also able to check in a half hour early which was helpful. Our only compliant was that it was cold in the bedroom without shutting the door to the hallway. 
9005989,232820432,2018-02-06,3331106,Amber,"Joshua and Sue's apartment was warm, comfortable and stylish.  We enjoyed our short stay and would stay again!"

9005989,234916307,2018-02-14,130786083,Susan,Good night’s sleep after an evening walk to a concert at the Egg.
9005989,237088985,2018-02-21,90385731,Kat,房间跟预料的差不多，但没想到是地下室。房间里有暖风机，所以也不觉得冷。建议这个房间住两人比较好，沙发床太软了。
9005989,237632156,2018-02-23,119625858,Kelsey,"Sue’s place was an excellent choice for my brief stay. I‎t was in a fantastic location. I‎t was walking distance to the park and right by any bars or restaurants on lark. Yet I‎t was still on a street that provided some privacy and escape from I‎t all. I️ made dinner at the air bnb, and Sue was very accommodating. She offered to lend me any extra appliciances I️ may need from her own place that the air bnb did not have and later during my stay she messaged me to check in to be sure I️ still was all set. The shower and sleeping conditions were excellent and very comfy. The only thing is; while the two rooms themselves are big, the place is relatively small. I‎t is also not well lit with natural light if that is a factor in your decision making. I️ would definitely recommend this place to others."
9005989,239144566,2018-02-28,4621219,Sophie,Le studio était vraiment parfait. On se sent comme à la maison

9005989,242279246,2018-03-11,120563566,Jackie,A couple of us were arriving at different times throughout the day. Sue accommodated us with a better schedule. Her place was really cosy and modern with a great kitchen. I would stay here again if I need to travel near the Albany center.
9005989,243582709,2018-03-16,60633455,Benjamin,Modern but homey studio space in the heart of Albany. Super clean and very safe!

9005989,244405675,2018-03-18,60986194,Fanny,"This place was just great. <br/>When you first come in the hallway smells amazing!!<br/>Sue was a great host, communication was great and the location is the best part, walking distance to all the interesting attractions. Washington Park is less than 5 minutes walk and the egg and the New York state museum are less than 15 minutes walk and the crossgates mall is a short Uber ride away.<br/>I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends."
9005989,245297447,2018-03-21,1567736,Ryan,"This is a clean, modern-looking apartment in a central location. It was an excellent pick for my two days in Albany. Sue was very responsive before, during, and after my stay. Thank you!"

The place was spotlessly clean, had more amenities than we needed (but definitely used!) and was a very relaxing and homey space. Sue is a great host and we will definitely be looking to stay again when we are in town!"
9005989,255794278,2018-04-21,124528895,Drey,"Sue was friendly and quick to respond to messages. She was also flexible with check in upon availability.<br/>There were minimal frills, but the space is nice and comfortable. It's also within easy walking distance of The Egg. I would definitely consider staying there again when traveling in the area."
9005989,256280137,2018-04-22,172338720,Sophie,"I loved staying here, it was stylish and cozy and I would absolutely stay again!"

9005989,258787230,2018-04-29,3195760,Min,"Sue's apartment is a lovely place to stay if you're in Albany for an extended visit! The unit is private, spacious, and super-clean, with a great kitchen space and comfortable bed.  We loved the surrounding neighborhood too — so many interesting shops and restaurants/bars within walking distance (or fast + cheap Uber ride), and also a quick walk to downtown Albany. The perfect place to crash if you are attending a concert at The Egg, Times Union Center, or Palace Theatre."
9005989,260968267,2018-05-05,168897553,John,"Right near downtown, but also around the corner from the park. Was a pleasant place to stay and the kitchen was beautiful"
9005989,261540694,2018-05-06,33873174,Katie,"Quiet apartment in a historic area right near a lot of restaurants, parks, and stores. Great place to stay for a night. Everything was clean and comfortable, and Sue was very responsive. Nice backyard too!"

Would definitely recommend this place to a friend."
9005989,268612462,2018-05-25,143809911,Matt,"Overall quite a nice place to stay. Had some issues, including no soap in the bathroom (but some in kitchen), low amount of toilet paper, no sheets for second bed, and the main bed’s supports caved and broke upon being gently sat on by someone weighing under 170lb. Despite these issues the place was in a great location and Sue was an incredibly accommodating host who was very apologetic about these issues and willing to work with us. Assuming these issues aren’t recurring, this is a wonderful location to stay in Albany for any reason."
9005989,269649315,2018-05-27,96071956,Anne,"Very nice place in a convenient location. Lots of cafes and coffee shops nearby and it is right by a nice park. <br/>To be frank, the area is one that you should stay aware of your surroundings in. The immediate area seemed safe, but it gets a bit rough feeling a couple blocks away."
9005989,270611093,2018-05-29,142385435,Larry,A great spot for enjoying the heart of Albany.  Place was spotless and very roomy.  Close to Lark St and the restaurants and pubs.  Everything you will need for spending a few days or more in Albany.

It reminded me of Park Slope, Brooklyn. It was very very clean, the kitchen and bathroom were top notch. Check in and out was a breeze. It was private and decorated beautifully and it’s so close to all the Local happenings. I highly recommend staying with Sue."

It is close to downtown and steps from a big park - which was great since I was traveling with my small dog. The hosts were very quick to respond and accommodated my late checkout request. Highly recommend!"
9005989,284973085,2018-07-02,46199922,Mark,Single common room can accommodate three people but unless you are really good friends it's a bit tight. Great street and around the corner is Lark Street which has some really great eating spots. Albany is a strange city. We went on a Sunday and the whole pl've was deserted.

The Host was very responsive and accommodating. Wish we would've planned to stay longer! Right by Washington Park and Lark St. (which has bars, restaurants etc.) Not far from the University. Bed is SO comfy, and shower is incredible.  Very nice place!"

We appreciated her accommodating us and enjoyed our stay!"
9005989,339401848,2018-10-21,44080574,Meaghan,"Sue's place is just as depicted in pictures. It is a basement apartment but super cozy, very clean and quiet.

It's not our fault we don't know the area. It should state more clearly what parking arrangements are. We asked Sue, her response was telling us where to  pay it. Not too pleased with that  outcome, will not stay with her again. Other our stay was absolutely wonderful."
9005989,344051218,2018-11-02,38746853,Pedro,The location is amazing and near to lark street and away enough that you can pretend you’re some where else. So you’re self a favor and book this place.

9005989,423553760,2019-03-14,3278598,Sandra,"Sue's apartment is a basement studio in a good walking neighborhood, which is about 10-15 minute walk from the capital. It's moderately appointed with a stocked kitchen, bathroom, and cozy bedroom/living room, but missing some of the creature comforts I often expect and enjoy when traveling (like extra blankets).  A good landing pad after a long day."
9005989,424369305,2019-03-16,243325293,Martha,Very nice and accomodating!!!
9005989,424979592,2019-03-17,113729054,Bryana,We stayed over for our night in the city to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day. Right in the heart of the city so it’s such a great value. The place was spotless and Sue provided so many thoughtful touches. My go-to place!
9005989,425991596,2019-03-19,211870731,Jourden,"Sue's place was excellent! Communication was easy. My friend's and I drove up from Queens to stay for the night and we arrived a bit sooner than expected, she allowed us to check-in a bit earlier which we appreciated so much! As far as parking, it was free overnight after certain times at different parts of the street but it was abundant! We had absolutely no problems with our stay. We initially thought the couch and bed were in separate rooms but they're actually in the same space, which was fine for us because we all wanted to watch a movie with their big TV! If I ever travel back up around these parts, I'd definitely stay here again."
9005989,426312105,2019-03-20,46553471,John,Sue's venue was perfect for us.
9005989,434180395,2019-04-07,58381142,Jessica,"Sue’s place fit our needs well. We were in town for a quick family gathering and needed to stay somewhere dog friendly. There is a large park (with an off leash area) at the end of the street that we were able to walk our dog in, although FYI if you’re interested it isn’t a park that I’d wander through at night. The WiFi was spotty- it worked sometimes and others not. The TV is a roku, so works through WiFi, so we never really got it to be able to stream anything. It didn’t bother us- we weren’t there to watch TV, just like to leave background noise on for the dog. The apartment itself is cute and really clean. It is a basement apartment. Within walking distance there are a handful of bars, cafes, and even a little juicery about 10 minutes away. It seems like the area is a developing, trendy spot."

9005989,436689428,2019-04-13,96010407,Katelyn,It was so nice to be back in Albany for my bridal shower and having been up a night early my friend and I needed a place to stay! This was right in the heart of Albany close to Washington Park and all the shops and restaurants on Lark. Sue was very responsive with messages and her place was so cute and clean! She has a Roku tv so you can watch Netflix and whatever else and a full kitchen if you want to cook. The bed is comfy and the whole place was very updated and nice. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay.

9005989,451980962,2019-05-12,1731607,Louisa,"This place is so cute and stylish. More than I expected from a ""garden-level"" apartment. The rooms were very clean. The finishes are new, lots of storage and nice touches like coffee and tea and even milk for our coffee and tea. Thank you Sue."

9005989,473932459,2019-06-22,225773169,Linda,Overall nice place. Excellent kitchen.  People with bad knees or balance problems should be careful as entrance has 4 steep steps with no handrail.
9005989,478252092,2019-06-29,85191097,Mary,The apartment is part of an historic row house with completely updated appliances.<br/>Lovely!
9005989,479812167,2019-07-01,93063297,Jill,Sue is a super responsive host! I flew in jetlagged and she was most gracious in readying the apartment a bit early so I could sleep!
9005989,482551659,2019-07-06,2269471,Anne,Great location and value. Fantastic kitchen.

9005989,491751684,2019-07-20,116604228,Kayla,The space was so cute and exactly what we needed for our night stay after a concert at Times Union Center!  It was a 20 minute walk to the venue and plenty of places to eat!! I would definitely recommend to others.

9005989,495850952,2019-07-26,28510962,Kelsea,"Wonderful stay, so convenient!!"
9005989,504331756,2019-08-07,12811510,Jocelyn + Jordan,"The apartment is clean, well furnished, and as described in the listing. We appreciated the window AC unit and the fan, as the weather was warm and humid during most of our stay. Sue is a great communicator with fast responses! As noted in the listing, the apartment is a BASEMENT unit - we did hear some noise from the residents above us (there was one evening where it sounded like there was a very upset child, and there was no hot water left for our showers; the other two evenings had no issues at all). Also, there is only street parking available (we were able to find parking within half a block every night); we gave Sue our car information so we did not have to move the vehicle every 2 hours (assume there is some sort of temporary electronic permit she submitted for our vehicle). All in all, a good stay in a central location."
9005989,505701328,2019-08-09,15192150,Fatima,"The apartment was conveniently located, sparkling clean, and included all of the amenities we needed. Check in was a breeze and Sue was quick to respond to all communication."
9005989,506394411,2019-08-10,112735332,Timothy,Transitional neighborhood.  We felt safe walking around during daylight and in unit overnight.
9005989,507320957,2019-08-11,128290851,Sam,Great place in a great location
9005989,508856070,2019-08-13,29591264,Steve,The place itself was as described however it is very close to a very dangerous looking neighbourhood. We were travelling with a baby and did not stay at this apartment
9005989,509445930,2019-08-14,252650303,Stephanie,"Room was just as described, very nice little area."
9005989,510081220,2019-08-15,236301361,William,Awesome place located right in Albany.  Within walking distance of restaurants.  Next time I plan a trip to Albany I would stay here again.  Amazing all around.
9005989,511707232,2019-08-17,68100943,Ian,"A great space for the night, thoughtfully furnished and easy to access."

9005989,515258660,2019-08-22,108969449,Leron,"Very nice place to stay. Next to the park, in walking distance of alot of places. Parking was a concern though."
9005989,515894604,2019-08-23,58241927,John,"Sue's apartment was exactly what we needed for a quick stopover in Albany. It is centrally located and allowed us to walk around downtown and enjoy the food, coffee, and drinks. Sue was quick to respond and had recommendations for places to visit. The apartment was clean and cozy."
9005989,516585862,2019-08-24,278665830,Josh,As described. Cute basement studio that was great for the nights stay!

9005989,523445388,2019-09-03,259243397,Monica,Great place in Albany! Right next to everything! A little hard to park but well worth it!
9005989,524291824,2019-09-05,59854743,Aaron,Sue's apartment was great for our one night stay in Albany. Great location. Clean and cozy.
9005989,524725938,2019-09-06,69101231,Shirelle,"The biggest problem I have that the place is a basement so watch the small letters, no window is opening so no fresh air. The place is very dirty ."
9005989,526078185,2019-09-08,15179064,Diana,"Great location, very close to restaurants and shops, also near public park with nice gardens. Only a short walk to downtown area. We had a function to attend at the Albany Hilton and it was an easy walk. Quiet neighborhood, didn't hear any street noise and it felt safe. Parking is restricted, but we have the same situation where we live. Just pay attention to the signs. Suggest using Lyft or Uber once you find a spot you can leave the car. (We never waited more than three minutes for a ride, even later in the evening.) The bed was very comfortable, large attractive kitchen but not set up for anything other than very basic cooking. Also, this is a basement apartment so not much natural light. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment and ate in restaurants, so it was fine for our purposes. Can't beat the location or the price."
9005989,526852430,2019-09-09,71690275,Nick,Great place
9005989,529277529,2019-09-14,287711712,J&#39;Anna,We felt it was a cozy stay. While it is noted there is street parking we had to park several blocks away. The door was diffucult to open and did not feel secure.  The shower curtain had hair on it.
9005989,532834151,2019-09-20,130252886,Carrie,Unfortunately as a super host I was very disappointed by my first stay. The space was moderately clean but in a basement and infested with really large ants. There was inadequate bedding on main bed and none for the second bed. I had to call the host after 10pm and she brought a blanket... that did not seem clean..sadly. She was very kind and apologetic about the missed bedding  and has offered a small refund for ant issue. Im still waiting for it. The door knobs and locks were falling off and I didn't feel comfortable taking a shower.
9005989,533365755,2019-09-21,291920856,Raymond,"Very nice studio apartment within walking distance to plenty of food and entertainment, easy communication and quick responses. Overall great stay, would recommend highly!"
9005989,534484711,2019-09-22,241554595,Jason,"Great apartment, great location and great host.  Sue made us aware of a large festival taking place that would make parking difficult and let us check-in hours earlier than the stated check-in time to help us out."
9005989,539963826,2019-10-02,58594784,Sarah,Great location and perfect space for my stay. Quant and cozy with modern style.
9005989,542450837,2019-10-06,114006126,Regina,"Sue has an awesome place! So quaint in such a great location. Super clean, and super cute. She was easy to communicate with and even checked in on us when the heat wasn’t working. 100% recommend this place!"
9005989,543324410,2019-10-07,82914150,Justin,"Great place, conveniently located. Host is super responsive and would definitely stay here again."
9005989,543795515,2019-10-08,136259469,Jonny,I suggest anyone coming to the area get this cozy lil place conveniently located in Albany. Beautiful and extra clean.
9005989,544260375,2019-10-09,113341448,Michael,"Nice apartment that was neat, clean and nice smelling. Host’s communication was very prompt, including immediate replacement of a blown light bulb at night.<br/>It is a basement apartment as listed and may feel dark and claustrophobic for some. We were fine for the one night. <br/>The area is certainly better than some we saw on the other side of Washington Ave that looked like ghettos. That said, some might be put off by the somewhat unsafe feel of the area (and it was just a feeling on our part). I think being able to operate the bedroom door lock when leaving the apartment would help people feel more secure.<br/>Have also suggested to the host to have a quilt on the bed rather than extra blankets that can get very heavy. An iron and general welcome pack (including tv operating instructions) would also be very useful for guests."
9005989,544657055,2019-10-10,99281645,Deanna,Sue’s place is outstanding.  It is clean and modern and fully equipped.  The location is outstanding.  There are many great restaurants and bars within a block on Lark.  The neighborhood get safe and cool.  Highly highly recommend this apartment.  Shower and supplies were awesome.  Bedding soft and comfy.
9005989,545531404,2019-10-12,48906004,Nicholas,"Great location that made it easy to walk around the city. The place was very well-kept with a unique charm. Our host made check-in, check-out, and parking very easy."

9005989,554063017,2019-10-25,13543199,Ryan,Great place in a great location! Seamless self check-in and I was able to leave my bags at their place upstairs for a bit on the day of check-out. Would come back if I’m back in Albany!
9005989,554492002,2019-10-26,36666375,Bob,We had a great time a beautiful place in a nice neighborhood
9005989,557212984,2019-10-31,140116935,Kadesha,"You can expect to have a ground floor apartment feel rather that a basement feel. Your around greet restaurants. Park literally a block away. Clean place , great responding hostess"
9005989,558105989,2019-11-02,20954182,Sandie,"Sugey has gone above and beyond to make this modernized BnB a home away from home. Everything is new but it still feels like home. It was surprisingly quiet being so close to Lark street. The location is superb to go anywhere in Albany or just enjoy the foliage in Washington park. It was easy to comminicate with the host. Though I only stayed one night, it was truly exceptional"
9005989,559067767,2019-11-03,5488404,Ezra,"Great location, was everything I needed it to be."

We would definitely use again . We stayed for a nearly a week during medical treatment and it worked great for us"
9005989,566078001,2019-11-18,66965860,Kyle,My family and I were just passing through the area and needed a place for a quick nights sleep. This was perfect for us vs. staying at typical hotel. Everything was as advertised and communication with Sugey was easy as could be.
9005989,567410512,2019-11-22,269175671,Nicholas,"Had a pleasant stay here! Sugey adds some nice touches to the apartment, and the location is quite nice, with great cafes, bars and restaurants around the corner. Perfect for my brief two-night stay in Albany."
9005989,568577229,2019-11-24,29095863,Sarah,Pleasant basement apartment in a convenient location and charming neighborhood. Photos are true to the space. Perfect for our 1-night stay in Albany.
9005989,571814756,2019-12-01,17891262,Gina,This is the perfect place to check out the fun parts of Albany. Right off of the park and Lark street. We were very lucky to have tons of parking due to the HOliday weekend.  Unlike many air bnbs this place has lots of extras in the bathroom and kitchen a big help if you didn’t pack your whole life.  Our tiny dog felt right at home here.
9005989,572969017,2019-12-04,117605507,Mariah,The place was very clean and conveniently located. We enjoyed our time there!
9005989,574678243,2019-12-08,175836073,Robert,"Warm, clean and inviting! Great place to stay. Thank you!!"
9005989,582703926,2019-12-27,11098308,Kyle,"We had a great visit! This is a basement apartment and while it is technically a studio, I'd say it's a huge studio. There's a bedroom and a separate full-size kitchen, as well as a full private bathroom. There was more than enough space for my wife and I and our two dogs. Speaking of dogs, there's also a small fenced backyard (shared access with the apartment above), which was very convenient for quick potty breaks. There are apartments above you, and you can hear them walking around occasionally, but it was not a major distraction at all.<br/>The neighborhood is a pretty active one, with a handful of spots open late on Lark Street, just a half block down from the apartment. It's a pretty urban feel within Albany. Washington Park is half a block the other way, which is a great option for walking your dogs. The only minus is no dedicated parking, but street parking wasn't very difficult for us. We often got a spot right on the street out front of the apartment, and when not there, right around the corner on Willet by the park. You have to get up and move the car in the morning as the street parking turns to 1-2 hour spots at 8am.<br/>This place is a great deal for a big studio apartment in an active neighborhood."
9005989,584806536,2019-12-30,148094660,Darrin,"Sugey is a great host and the space is perfect.  Convenient to basically everything and anything you would want.  Sugey was quick to respond and the listing was immaculate.  Great place, will come again."
9005989,586100484,2020-01-01,43044275,Steven,"Very good communication. Quick, accurate responses and very friendly.  The apartment was perfectly clean as well."
9005989,589264700,2020-01-05,38928796,Margaret,Convenient. Clean. Cozy. This is a great place to stay if you want to be close to Albany Med but not so close you have to hear sirens. Lark Street has some fun retail attractions including a great coffee shop and Mexican bar/restaurant. Both are just around the corner.
9005989,590403826,2020-01-08,1191441,Justin,"great location and comfortable accommodation, id definitely stay again!"

9005989,592254649,2020-01-12,230083257,Shannon,We had a very nice stay! The space is lovely and there is a ton of street parking. There was also so much to do and many places to eat within walking distance. Sugey was an excellent host and was very communicative. Would definitely stay again if we are back in the area!
9005989,593618233,2020-01-16,72350316,Trisha,"This apartment although termed as a studio was, so much nicer than your typical one room set-up. The bedroom is separate from the kitchen and bathroom - making the feel much larger and privately welcome! Very easy to check-in and location convenient to all!"

9005989,599312150,2020-01-29,194211076,Roshni,Sugey's place was extremely clean and easy to find. We couldn't find street parking that night so I messaged Sugey (around 10:30 pm!) and she responded within 5 minutes telling me where I could park. The place itself was perfect and bigger than expected. I was staying for one night for an interview in the morning and it was just what I needed. Thanks again!

9005989,625230161,2020-05-18,71129181,Zahia,What a lovely stay! Sugey was quick to respond to my inquiries and the check-in process was seamless. The place was exactly as pictured. There was a door separating the kitchen/dining room area and bathroom which made the space feel more like a one-bedroom than a studio. This was incredibly cozy with the lights dimmed. The location was perfect - a quick walk away from Washington Park and a street full of local eateries. Parking was on the street but I had no trouble finding a spot. We are incredibly grateful that Sugey welcomed us into this space and would gladly return for another weekend of relaxation!

9005989,739452056,2021-03-15,2046878,Todd,"Amazing location in the heart of center square. Beautiful block and walkable to all the best restaurants and right off of Washington Park. Great place if you’re a dog owner. The kitchen could use a few more staples (pots, pans, utensils, etc). It’s a lower level apartment so a bit dark, but over all a nice place."

It was surprisingly warm the day we spent visiting, so, being a basement apartment was quite advantageous for this very reason. It was comfortable and cool. Neat and organized and the shower was amazing. The bed was super comfortable also."

9005989,755863124,2021-05-07,232046558,Ma'At,This place is very beautiful and it is on the single level which is even better.
9005989,759218319,2021-05-16,63382,Michael,My trip to Albany was a wonderful experience. With Sugey's help and kindness I was able to pull of birthday weekend for dear friend. She was amazing from day one. The place was great. Highly recommended this place. Great location to the most beautiful park with Tulips throughout. <br/>Thank you so much for all your kindness and help Sugey.
9005989,760991948,2021-05-22,5382126,Patrick,"Great place to stay in Albany. Quiet and close to everything. Place flat was clean and well maintained. Host were great, and helped us with ensure we were situated with parking. They also made us aware that they were always available if needed. I would stay here again."
9005989,763359314,2021-05-28,5376425,Hailey,"While Sugey was a very responsive host and made check-in and check-out very easy, we did not find the place to be as clean as we would have liked. It is a dark, pet-friendly basement apartment, so maybe we should have expected as much, but we were disappointed in the overall dinginess of the place and what did not seem like sufficient cleaning in regular times, much less COVID times. That said, when we raised it to the hosts, they immediately responded and refunded the cleaning fee. So, five stars on communication, but fewer stars for all else."
9005989,765015408,2021-05-31,52182612,Hansarah,"We loved the place. Very clean and the host communicated quickly. The place is a bit cold so extra extra comforter would have been helpful or a working heater but other than that, everything was as described and the area was good too. Plenty to do when it’s not raining. Someone did break into our vehicle and stole our glasses. The only misfortune but that’s NY for you!"

This is the best basement apartment I've ever lived in -- super comfy and quiet at night. If you're stopping by Albany for a few nights, you can't go wrong with this place."
9005989,767365075,2021-06-06,29591866,Philip,the place is nice but basement apartments are just not for me but the value was worth it... the host answer back very quick and the bed was extremely comfortable

9005989,428172460655261462,2021-08-13,192849292,Megan,"Great location with lots of food and shops in the area. Easy to find and check in. Typical city parking which was expected and not an issue. Only issue was cleanliness tbh and I’m not a clean freak by any means. Nothing noticeable at first glance but when going to use things in kitchen many of the cabinets were significantly dirty inside, anything you would need to use would definitely need to be thoroughly cleaned before being used in the kitchen....   old batteries and used dirty napkins just thrown in lazy Susan with lots of dirt/dust and random crumbs etc like they haven’t been wiped down in some time . Also old used face mask in bedside desk which was.....gross tbh with the current state of things. Old half eaten ice cream containers in freezer and random used small food items in fridge. All in all could use a deep clean but just at first glance appears clean without further inspection. Also no smoke detector. Just an empty bracket where one should be. If this place was clean it would be a 5 star location and rental but it really needs a good cleaning. <br/>We only stayed one night just to crash and get up early and go so there was no point in voicing an issue at 11pm when we arrived when we were leaving at 8:30 the following morning."

9005989,438332422514748398,2021-08-27,62859600,Jennifer,"The studio is not bad but the humidity odor and cleaning needs to get better because I found hair in the freezer meaning was not cleaned before my check in and of course I can not cook there after see it. <br/>Overall looks clean but needs to do a deep cleaning and remove dust. Also, remember that are different people staying, for some people can be ok if found the sofa pillows dirty but others can feel it disgusting to seat.  Also, on the side of the sofa we found a red pants for the other people."

9005989,510877540160535179,2021-12-05,309097845,Mae,"This modern and spacious basement-studio apparent offers a full kitchen, bedroom, and plenty of storage. Clean inside and outside. We visited in late Fall so the provided space heater was definitely a bonus (though not desperately needed!) Owners have an adjacent doorway inside that leads up to the main home. Conversation is easily heard from their unit but when shut, there are two doors (theirs and yours) separating the units. Love the love notes previous guests have left. HOT shower, clean/fresh towels, and plenty of provided shower essentials. Loved this stay, love Albany."
9005989,520211303086618991,2021-12-18,69112579,May,"Stayed for just one night and didn't spend too much time in the apartment, but communication was good (she allowed us to check in much earlier, which was nice), check-in/out was easy, and apartment is cozy and clean. Location is convenient. No complaints!"

9005989,530465975748106119,2022-01-01,62469425,Mason,"This rental is SUPER warm and cozy and has some great features - the standing shower is amazing and the beds were really comfortable. Plus it's located in a very cool historic brownstone. Sugey was a responsive and helpful host. We were very happy with the location and could explore nearby Lark Street and Washington Park. I found the kitchen to be a little understocked so if you plan to do any real cooking then you might want to bring extra supplies. Also, if plan to drive check in about parking ahead of time. Overall, I would definitely recommend this spot for anyone looking for a fun weekend in Albany!"
9005989,536227988597394421,2022-01-09,406822217,Gavin,Its in the basement，but a really nice place to stay. The door is bit hard to find when we first arrived. overall an excellent experience.

We were 3 and that was already quite tight.The sofabed is unfortunately not comfortable at all.<br/>Would have expected additional sheets for the sofabed to be prepared as well as fresh covers for the pillow. The blanket for the sofabed was ripped- should be exchanged.<br/>The appartement is around the corner of a nice park and a nice street with Restaurants and Bars.

9005989,696337838946902558,2022-08-18,67142038,Naheyan,The place is very cosy and clean. It is a basement apartment so it has that musty smell. The apartment has everything you need for a stay. I went there for work so i spent most of the day in the apartment working. The bathroom is clean the kitchen is big and is separated from the bedroom which is fantastic. Theres extra sofa bed in the room which can accommodate extra people. The location is fantastic right next to shops and Washington Park which is beautiful. Sugey is a super host she replied instantly to all my queries and also helped me with the street parking situation.

9005989,734074009843338026,2022-10-09,133629713,John,"Wonderful location, on a quiet street, but a five minute (or even less) walk to many restaurants and cafes. It's the most walkable part of the city too. The place was very comfortable and a lot more quiet than I had thought it would be, since it's right on the street. Nice bathroom and shower too. Sugey was great at responding to some questions I had. I'd definitely stay here again."

9005989,820378792866019120,2023-02-05,220071050,Brent,Nice place. Enjoyed the stay. <br/>Was a little cold inside due to old doors and windows. Neighborhood seemed a little sketchy at night. <br/>Lots of cool bars and restaurants within walking distance. <br/>Parking is on street but had zero issues with parking all 3 nights. <br/>Good value.

The area could not have been better, half a block from the main strip of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. Half a block from Washington park, which was fantastic since Sugey allowed me to bring my dog! Thank you so much for letting us stay in your home."
9005989,857198322983112004,2023-03-28,380119628,Gretchen,The place could have been cleaner. I had to sweep and wipe things down. Pet hair and pet food on the floor. The comforter was not clean. The whole downstairs studio is heated by one space heater. I chose this place for convenience of location.  It was convenient for location but not worth what i paid. It has potential. I hope its cleaner for the next people.  Sugey was nice but im not going to rate it higher than what it actually was.  It served its purpose.
9005989,860889424502824329,2023-04-02,188601675,Jonah,Sugey's place was a great find. It was homey and had everything we needed. There was even a space heater for the bedroom to keep it toasty. And she was quick to respond when we had questions. Thank you for hosting!

9005989,900058531591450440,2023-05-26,237937885,Donna,"I stayed here for three weeks and it quickly felt like home. I had everything I needed. The hosts couldn't have been more helpful. They live right upstairs but allowed me my privacy. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great. I was able to store my bicycle in the locked foyer. There was everything  I needed within short walking distance. Washington park is a block away and beautiful to walk through. I had no parking issues during the entire stay. There is a EV Chargepoint (free!) around the corner in a parking lot. I could go on and on, but I'll just say that if I decide to turn to Albany in the fall, I will definitely book this apartment."
9005989,904345388561665984,2023-06-01,187602209,Susan,Everything was just right at Sugey’s place. It was 90 degrees outside but her basement was cool and comfortable. Plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The instructions were straightforward and it was easy to access. We had everything we needed.<br/>The neighborhood has gorgeous old buildings and a wonderful park nearby. I felt safe and enjoyed walking there.<br/>We will definitely stay here again when we visit Albany.

I needed an extended place to stay because the closing is taking longer than expected and found Sugey’s place to be the perfect place to stay for multiple days. Sugey was very responsive and her place was clean and cozy. Perfect place to stay in my opinion; I felt right at home."
9005989,936931696904318381,2023-07-16,495908365,Thomas,Basement apartment in well-kept historic building. Photos are accurate. Thoughtfully stocked with full kitchen. Large combination A/C with de-humidifier is effective. Steps from Lark Street and Washington Park. Host was extremely helpful about parking and it was easy to find and close by. How you feel about that neighborhood will determine how you will enjoy your stay.
9005989,938406572300524527,2023-07-18,341012814,Angel,It felt nice to have somewhere to stay while exploring the college near this stay!
9005989,946367715798337335,2023-07-29,86757090,Amber,Sugey’s place was clean and had everything we needed!
9005989,950796742056333774,2023-08-04,352518188,Jenee,I actually met the host in person she was a nice friendly woman I loved how soon as u walk in you see all the positive things people loved about this Airbnb I mean years and years of nothing but good positive feedback of the host and the place is clean and everything is new my favorite thing was the shower head It made taking a shower refreshing and fun 😆❤️ will return in the future
9005989,952259431943161630,2023-08-06,64243735,Jamie,"Great place, right near the park. It's listed as a studio but is really bigger. Living and bedroom are one room, but there's also a hallway leading to a big kitchen. It's a basement apartment, so a bit dark, but very safe and comfortable. We'll be back!"
9005989,955799950589632865,2023-08-11,219176395,Drew,"Everything about this listing was exactly as expected. Sugey was a great host, super responsive. We even had a problem with the oven and she was there in no time to take care of it!"
9005989,957966588737102378,2023-08-14,529880170,Zahra,Thanks!
9005989,962343423150372009,2023-08-20,419832388,Kaci,"Nice place, comfy bed"
9005989,977579495112403999,2023-09-10,189095426,Geo,Sugey’s Airbnb was fantastic! Stayed there with a friend for two nights and had no issues at all. Very cozy and felt super safe where it was. The first door to get to the actual Airbnb door takes a good amount of force to open and close all the way just a little tip. Sugey was super responsive when I asked about parking on the street overnight. Would definitely recommend!
9005989,984831506830757353,2023-09-20,325474959,Kevin,Exactly as advertised. Definitely recommend!<br/>Not a huge apartment but it’s more than necessary for one or two people. I would certainly stay here again!
9005989,987681822713729673,2023-09-24,532194326,Gregg,Good location that was close to restaurants and bars. Charming area of “Brownstone’s”
9005989,1002965473066873014,2023-10-15,7270165,Max,perfect spot for a quick getaway or if you're passing through.
9005989,1007314505158439884,2023-10-21,18149639,Kelly,We had a great stay with our dogs! Sugey’s place is right by lots of entertainment and a big park—great location. The apartment is also quite large for a “studio.” We’d happily stay here again!
9005989,1010917543217005065,2023-10-26,249925085,Beth,One mile walk to Palace Theater which was great.  Fairly easy to find with street parking.  Front door sticky to open and close.  When opened in the morning one of the window panels popped out which looked like it was caulked recently.  Bed was comfortable.  Kitchen was ok but some appliances appear to have seen better days.  Over all a good stay.  Met our needs for the night.
9005989,1013055815624539895,2023-10-29,12757905,Erin,"Had a great stay here! Sugey was very responsive and a great host, thank you!"
9005989,1037723836084734622,2023-12-02,153324018,Jake,"I really enjoyed my time here. There are a ton of walkable food and beverage options on Lark St right around the corner from the Airbnb. The Capital Plaza and museum aren’t very far either and were also easily walkable. Washington Park is also right around the corner which made for some nice walks during the day. Parking is easy, there was plenty right out in front in the street. The space itself was great. The bed was very comfortable and was kept warm and cozy with a nice space heater. The kitchen area had nice appliances and a well stocked set of utensils, plates, and pans for cooking while I was there. The bathroom and shower were also very nice. I would gladly stay here again in the future and very much recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the city."
9005989,1038471533200769807,2023-12-03,451487582,Joshua,"Enjoyed the place, made me want to stay in Albany longer."
9005989,1044979051075220072,2023-12-12,477271914,Bryson,"Sugey was very responsive and answered any questions I had about parking. I was only here for one night for an emergency trip for work, but I would stay here long term in the future. For an Airbnb that allowed dogs, the price was wicked cheap. Thank you for a stress free stay"
9005989,1048658596284744455,2023-12-17,420132499,Steven,Good stay and place was well kept. Location was great. Didnt have much time to really enjoy apt as i was visiting fam.
9005989,1059499408474335953,2024-01-01,291842229,Alfredo,Excellent place to stay
9005989,1068160239402898144,2024-01-13,9575630,Jean,It was nice to have a park nearby to walk the dog. The place is comfortable and quiet. I would come back.
9005989,1079111745074549113,2024-01-28,282117319,Lisandro,"The stay was amazing, it was clean, had everything we needed. We also felt really safe. Thanks Sugey for allowing us to stay and accommodate your space."
9005989,1083437641212670562,2024-02-03,19738856,Adam,The place was exactly what we needed
9005989,1094252448152812228,2024-02-18,77333648,Joseph,Sugey was communicative and helpful about travel logistics and her place was comfortable and convenient. It was a pleasure to stay there!
9005989,1099306460009064713,2024-02-25,11346846,Theresa,"Steps away from Lark St and Washington Park, the apartment couldn’t be better located. It was larger than I expected, with a large and full kitchen in addition to the combined bedroom and living space. Although it’s a basement unit, I didn’t hear any noise from upstairs. It was the perfect space for us and so conveniently located - and at a great price! We will be back."
9005989,1114510582394916760,2024-03-17,283200746,Janine,Perfect place for a weeeknd get away in a great location.
9005989,1118953935909498386,2024-03-23,13230947,Andrew,Super convenient for a conference downtown. Clean and in a decent neighborhood. Sugey was wonderful at communication.
9005989,1129750454318512143,2024-04-07,110533623,Beth,"Location, location, location! Perfect spot to spend a couple of days and walkable to so many restaurants, shops, cute neighborhoods and venues the area has to offer. 100% recommend staying here, thank you Sugey!"
9005989,1130514343451287694,2024-04-08,149105798,Doug,Great location in Albany
9005989,1133379694233103639,2024-04-12,118362030,Will,"Having lived in Albany in the past, Sugey's spot felt like a return to comfort in the city."
9005989,1136246029526030287,2024-04-16,457164137,Peter,"Clean, comfortable and responsive host - what else to say?!"
9005989,1144965052064484294,2024-04-28,144817455,Kaeli,This was a great stay and close to everything!
9005989,1158793252451002147,2024-05-17,570665441,Roy,I stayed here while in town for work and found it comfortable and conveniently located.
9005989,1166015616783940724,2024-05-27,97839208,Ashley,Perfect location!
9005989,1169619894388940137,2024-06-01,204774190,Noah,solid no-frills choice
9005989,1175381015678093941,2024-06-09,157510291,Laine,The space was very dusty and not clean.  We felt as though we couldn't take our shoes off.  There were dirty dishes in the dishwasher and the the bathroom trash was full. There were visible cobwebs hanging around.  The bathroom carpet was dirty.  There was a ton of noise which made sleep difficult.
9005989,1179111952340708400,2024-06-14,571945170,Jacob,Nice quiet neighborhood and relaxing Airbnb
9005989,1180455323634322142,2024-06-16,223684561,Evan,Great stay. First time using the app. Host gave clear instructions and responsive. Apt is in central of the city and walkable.
9005989,1185523181016676275,2024-06-23,448659605,Jake,Great place. Clean and centrally located. Would definitely stay again.
9005989,1192059601547520785,2024-07-02,33108335,John,"Had a great weeklong stay at Sugey’s. The apartment is spacious, comfortable, and had everything I needed. I also enjoyed its proximity to lots of good eats and Washington Park."
9005989,1195739907277852032,2024-07-07,87376389,Tyrone,great spot. everything you need.
9005989,1202931657980405286,2024-07-17,533897739,Chris,she was very communicative and offered am extra frying pan as i needed it.  Great private place! shower was great also. comfortable.  would stay again. it was quiet. everything functional except wifi....a bit spotty .
9501054,61300132,2016-02-02,51688255,Eric,Gregg was an amazing host from day 1 to move out day. He went out of his way to help me several times during my stay including helping me retrieve my lost phone. The room itself was very spacious and exactly as advertised. The apartment is also located in a nice area of Albany. I was in walking distance of many restaurants and bars. I would definitely recommend to others looking for a place to stay in downtown Albany. 
9501054,61986430,2016-02-10,51606607,Haavard,"This place had what I needed. A bed, shower, wifi, it was close to the Times Union Center and it was a bar one minute down the street. 
<br/>The room was basic (but big) and not cozy."
9501054,62323232,2016-02-13,8677918,Dennis,"The place was fine. The host was responsive. Not a luxury room, but adequate for the price. The location is central in Albany. "
9501054,62740409,2016-02-16,21543879,Natasha,"The place was perfect for my needs because the Convention Center was up the block. Like the listing says, your shower and bathroom is upstairs. Also, I was very happy that we had heat!!! I was in Albany for the one of the coldest weekend in the year. "
9501054,66693246,2016-03-24,1803161,Shivani,"It's a beautiful area and very convenient but the room was not what I expected based on the listing. First, and most importantly, I did not have a bed. There was an air mattress when I was guaranteed a bed. The door did not lock and the bathroom door did not close. He provided basic information about where the bathroom was but due to no lighting, I had to go on a scavenger hunt with my cell phone to find the bathroom. "
9501054,66925057,2016-03-25,23541583,Céleste,"Chambre conforme à la photo et facilement accessible.
<br/>Cependant les draps étaient sales et la chambre était sans chauffage alors qu'il faisait 2 degrés dehors ! Mauvaise expérience même si pratique pour une nuit."
9501054,67333377,2016-03-28,13100313,Jamall,"The room was perfectly fine and just what I needed for the weekend that I was in Albany. I didn't have huge expectations since I knew what I was getting but I didn't feel uncomfortable at all and had all the space that I needed. Gregg was very responsive when I had some problems finding the shower.
<br/>
<br/>The location is great since downtown, the bus station, and Lark St. are all within relatively quick walking distance (under 10 minutes). There's a bus line on Madison Ave. but others are close enough if needed. The area near the apartment seemed safe enough at night, but one should exercise caution anyway since it is Albany."
9501054,70029339,2016-04-15,67111246,Warren,Great place. Perfect for what i needed.
9501054,71112631,2016-04-23,66371626,Robin,comfortable place to crash
9501054,71195467,2016-04-24,13100313,Jamall,"See my previous review, except this time I actually met Gregg, who was very friendly and helpful, in person."
9501054,71705364,2016-04-27,18401543,Daniel,This room was exactly what I needed for my purposes: close to the Albany state buildings and in a fairly quite neighborhood. There was plenty of space in my room and the internet was reliable.
9501054,72225834,2016-05-01,68378368,Jonathan,great - nice big room
9501054,72992248,2016-05-06,64485536,Melody,"The residence was very nice, I couldn't have asked for a more ""homey"" comfortable place. It was neat, clean, and had everything I desired much better experience than a hotel. As far as Greg, he is a gracious host and I am fortunate to have had a host this kind and accommodating. "
9501054,74084469,2016-05-13,46022453,Padraic,Gregg took care of everything from start to finish. Wonderful stay. Would definitely stay again. Thanks. 
9501054,74622106,2016-05-16,6277131,Tom,"I didn't meet Gregg in person, but he was super friendly and helpful over email, and staying in the house was exactly as I'd been led to imagine it would be. I slept very well, and crept out quietly in the morning. Super AirBnB."
9501054,76021163,2016-05-24,7659951,Sheilagh,"I was in search of a place for one night in Albany before taking the train home the next morning. Gregg's place was close to the train station, some restaurants and a grocery store. It is a very basic room. I will say I was a bit confused as to how many people were staying in the house. I thought it was Gregg's home, but I don't believe he lives there. I was a bit confused about the many locks on the door and where the shower was located. Gregg did respond quickly to all my questions. There is a lot of clutter in the hallway, but the room was certainly adequate. I don't know Albany well, but it seems very centrally located (and a short taxi to the train station!)."
9501054,76868437,2016-05-29,65639814,Alan,"There was a total mixup on the days - the person staying there before me thought he had another night there which was my night.
<br/>
<br/>It turned out I did not stay there.  My ex-wife and I shared a hotel room because her AirBnB was not good.
<br/>
<br/>Gregg is refunding me my money.  
<br/>
<br/>I will review that process once I see the refund."
9501054,77467078,2016-06-01,72370718,Joris,Very comfy and charming room with a very nice host who even gave me some more time as I needed it.
9501054,82068031,2016-06-26,79716120,Michael,As others mentioned - Gregg emailed instructions almost immediately and the stay was excellent. Fresh fowls & soap. 
9501054,82833883,2016-06-29,8299835,Arthur,"Easy to find, centrally located, anything promised was there, responses to questions were very quick "
9501054,85890783,2016-07-13,2479641,Ananda,"To start off, I should say that there really isn't a better deal than Gregg's place in central Albany. I looked. It is easy to get to and is very convenient for anyone trying to do New York Bar related things. As a man traveling alone, and in Albany for less than a full day, it was all I needed. Gregg was very quick in communicating with me.
<br/>
<br/>I should mention, though, that the room is in the basement and can seem a bit odd. There's not much light and there are cobwebs around. The bathroom is upstairs and the shower is in a closet. There's no sink or water access on the basement level. If you're planning to stay for any length of time, this might not be ideal. But, again, for one night, as a guy traveling on his own, this worked just fine and was a great deal."
9501054,86090299,2016-07-14,43815145,Sophie,"reasonable price for staying in NY, good location to visit the egg, the NY state museum and the capital area. It is a ground level room, the building is old fashion and the surroundings are a little bit mess. If you travel as a single girl, think twice as the shower place can not be locked, and there is a guy living there (although he is friendly). But if you have limited budget, this will be a good place, after all it is in NY."
9501054,91894029,2016-08-07,35392155,Joshua,"Great room, looks and comes as promised. Parking is on the street which may be difficult to find a free space but Gregg has a garage to use in case. The bedroom door needs a key whenever you open and close it, which can be annoying sometimes, but it's good safety if you are a cautious person. The house is about a 20-second walk from a cafe/bar which is convenient if you need a drink or food nearby. Gregg was very responsive to messages and helpful with everything. Would recommend."
9501054,96704627,2016-08-24,81179180,Nicholas,I like how there were two water bottles in the fridge and there is always 2 fresh towels and soap.
9501054,97238665,2016-08-26,18748683,Lucile,"Greggs place is spacious, private, well-located and just as described!"
9501054,98021931,2016-08-29,43038093,Harmony,Great place for short stay in Albany. Gregg is very accommodating and flexible. He accommodated me at the last minute after a very busy day which I appreciate.  
9501054,98877809,2016-09-02,42653353,Michael,"This was the first time I stayed at a townhouse and it was a different experience than I was normally accustomed to, but in a good way. Gregg was in constant communication and very helpful. I appreciated it that he gave me a booklet on interest sites to explore in New York. Thanks Gregg!!!"
9501054,100697001,2016-09-10,91611149,Ravi,"Greeg was a great host and though i never met him personally, we communicated well over phone whenever necessary. The location was in mid downtown and everything was very accessible. I highly recommend his place."
9501054,101826957,2016-09-15,88736296,Rony,"I enjoyed my stay at Gregg's place. While I was only there for one night, Gregg was really helpful. He even got me an iron from his house once I told him that I needed a dry cleaning place to iron my shirt. The room was nice and clean, and the shared bathroom was also clean. The entrance to the room was a bit messy, but at the time I was leaving, Gregg was working on tidying it up. I simply liked the place and how helpful Gregg was. I would stay there again if I ever go back to Albany."
9501054,102616734,2016-09-18,282712,Darva,"I contacted Gregg 4 or 5 hours before my stay (at the last minute) when I realized I didn't want to drive through the night to get to my final destination.  
<br/>Gregg's home is located conveniently off the interstate and he responded immediately.  He was kind enough to give me a few details which I hadn't seen in his listing.  
<br/>Upon arrival I had to circle the block, then blocks to find a place to park.  Then, with no porch or any of the out door lights turned on it was challenging to find the house with the red door,  my entrance and key pad.   The room is located on the ground floor, the entrance to the ground floor is behind and beneath the steps shown in the picture!  That is one dark place when the lights are all off. 
<br/>I wasn't sure what I'd find upon entering but thankfully there was an inside hall light on.  The room is the first room on the left - I opened the door and again - could not find a light;  none of the lamp switches worked!   I eventually located an extension cord that was unplugged and then ... Bravo - LIGHT - and what a large room!  
<br/>The room is very spacious  and clean.  It has a single bed, microwave, coffee maker,  all very adequate for a night's sleep.  The bathroom is upstairs in the main part of the house, but the bathroom needs a good cleaning.  I took a peak at the shower and decided not to use it.
<br/>I fell asleep peacefully but was jolted awake at 2:45AM by lots of loud noise and commotion upstairs that lasted for about 15 minutes.
<br/>I left in the morning - did not have the opportunity to meet Gregg. 
<br/>  "
9501054,104951781,2016-09-29,45117525,Albert,arrived really late the tentant from upstairs open the door it was ight you know not bad its a room and the location is either bad or good depending on how you look at it. 
9501054,105148028,2016-09-30,65742362,Erin,I had to check in a little early and Gregg accommodated that with no problem! Clean room with lots of privacy- perfect for my quick stay in Albany!
9501054,105352827,2016-10-01,23420264,Xi,"DO NOT BOOK HIS PROPERTIES!!! THIS IS A JOKE!!! I obtained permission from Gregg before booking, and I arrived at the property in the midnight, but all the rooms were occupied. The room that I was supposed to live in was occupied by a couple which also booked the room from AirBnb. The other two rooms inside and upstairs were locked. There was no place to stay. I am requesting full refund."
9501054,106168851,2016-10-04,14213147,D,The house is within 15 minute walking distance from capital building and food/amenities. If you're seeking affordable basic accommodations then consider this house. 
9501054,106320609,2016-10-05,56702158,Yin,"Great location, excellent communications with host."
9501054,106496049,2016-10-06,3470710,Michael,Was really great location and great responsive host.
9501054,108983378,2016-10-18,71522486,C G.,Located close to Empire Plaza. 
9501054,109127341,2016-10-19,15097523,Benjamin,"This is an excellent value but very much just someone's house. The room I stayed in was extremely spacious, and the exterior of the house was beautiful. It's on a pleasant street within walking distance of everywhere you need to be to swear in to the NY bar. 
<br/>
<br/>The reasons it is so preposterously cheap include, I assume: the fact that the shower opens into a common hallway (I.e., you have to undress and hang your clothes in the hallway) and does not have a locking door; the room I stayed in had three interior doors, two of which were behind furniture so I didn't open them, but it was slightly unnerving having non-locking doors into my room without knowing where they went (light was shining under one of them so I assume it was the other suite); the wifi was a little spotty in my experience, although it was enough to survive on; the locks, particularly the one to the bedroom I stayed in, are very fidgety and take some getting used to if you haven't used those old-timey cartoon keys before (which I hadn't).
<br/>
<br/>I didn't quite grasp the process from Gregg's instructions but he responded to emails quickly to clear everything up. 
<br/>
<br/>If you're okay with the above, enjoy paying about 30% of what you would at a hotel! "
9501054,109266216,2016-10-20,40587372,Dakotah,This is a very nice and comfortable place in a convenient part of downtown.  Great option for the value.  And Gregg was really helpful and easy to get in touch with. 
9501054,113233871,2016-11-11,25234054,Hashim,"I checked in earlier and gregg accommodated that. The place is pretty much as described and the bus stop is right in front of the house. Good value for money.

9501054,113930937,2016-11-14,100976269,Ahmed,Gregg was a nice a guy and very helpful. I asked for an iron and he immediately brought a brand-new one for me
9501054,114315671,2016-11-17,9130921,Justin,The house was well located and the room was quite large. Instructions were fairly simple to follow. Thanks Gregg.
9501054,117065126,2016-12-04,105628585,Vijay,The bedroom is very spacious and comfortable. Only thing I feel is the heating system has to upgrade. 
9501054,120083415,2016-12-07,103364137,Niccolò,"La zona è strategicamente perfetta, molto vicina al centro e a 15 minuti a piedi dal luogo in cui si deve giurare per il NY bar exam. La stanza è leggermente polverosa ma decisamente molto spaziosa.
<br/>Nel complesso l'esperienza è stata senza dubbio positiva e consiglio a chiunque si trovi ad Albany di soggiornare qui, anche perché il rapporto qualità/prezzo è molto conveniente."
9501054,120311799,2016-12-09,24127234,Alex,Gregg was very helpful and went out of his way to make sure I was setup. He made himself available when I ran into an issue. Great place to stay!
9501054,120461873,2016-12-10,22393583,Michael,This was my first experience with Airbnb and Gregg was fantastic. His communication was fast and the room itself was lovely. Location wise it was perfect too!
9501054,121026546,2016-12-13,36358895,Aleena,"Great value for money and great location. I walked from the bus station to the house in 10 minutes. Gregg was very easy to reach. When I complained about the cold, gregg got me a new heater on top of the central heating. Overall great experience. "
9501054,123724598,2016-12-30,100039638,Matthew,The place was centrally located by the state capital and was walkable to restaurants and bus stops.  
9501054,124288952,2017-01-01,87816995,Daniel,"This was a very interesting airbnb. I would not recommend this listing if you are planning to have additional guests other than what is given. My girlfriend decided to come to Albany for New Years eve (last minute decision) and since there was no explicit warning about bringing other guests, I decided that this would not be a huge problem as I have been to other airbnb's where this was not major, especially since we only spent 5 hours in total in one room. Going to the public bathroom, we were having conversations about our great night and was greeted by someone (did not look like the man in this picture) who yelled at us for being way too loud and told my girlfriend she needed to get the hell out of this place (which was very upsetting to both of us). Eventually we were able to stay for the night and were told to get downstairs and be quiet. All in all, it was not a very good experience. It seems that this host is very comfortable with a certain lifestyle and I would not recommend this place if you are planning on (having any extra guests using the extra bathroom or coming in late: the house is old and it is hard to be quiet). I believe gregg lives in this house which may not be 100% clear based on the listing (either that or he has someone stay in the house because the person who I was confronted by looked nothing like the person in this picture). If you are planning on spending very little time in this place, enjoy sleeping on a very small bed specifically for one person, and are quiet then this place has a great location and gregg makes it very easy to check in and out. "
9501054,129541229,2017-01-31,101984760,Shah,I stayed at this beautiful brownstone for a month. Gregg was an excellent host who was very responsive to texts and calls. This location is close to all things in downtown Albany. I highly recommended it. 
9501054,130677699,2017-02-07,12708246,Sam,"Well Furnished room centrally located in Downtown Albany, if you need to be within walking distance to Capital or other downtown destinations this a great location."
9501054,132201521,2017-02-16,12540615,Adam,"Gregg's place was great - very convenient and centrally located for an unbeatable price. I arrived late (1am), but Gregg left a set of keys in a lock box outside the front entrance, so I was able to let myself in no problem. The room itself was spacious and comfortable. Will stay here again if I'm ever in Albany. "
9501054,132554285,2017-02-18,19658470,Alfredo,Very clean room as advertised.  Was close to everything I needed to get to in Albany.  Especially for the price.  I plan to stay with Greg when I am in Albany again.

9501054,134992174,2017-03-02,19512172,Roberto,"As usual Gregg's listing is amazing.  The room was spacious, warm, and had everything that I needed to get ready for work in the morning.  Gregg is also super responsive to calls, text messages, and emails to make your stay a smooth as possible.  Gregg is simply an amazing host"
9501054,135640596,2017-03-05,3142542,Sebastian,"Great little place in a historic house right next to Empire Plaza and the Cathedral of Immaculate conception. Good Italian restaurants very close. Shared bathroom up the stairs. Place very clean and very spacious room. Very quiet at night. 5 minutes drive from Amtrak station. Gregg is a very attentive host, brought an extra heater on a cold day."

9501054,137447939,2017-03-15,52674780,Drew,"Not a bad place. Was very beneficial to be so close to the plaza, especially because we got slammed with snow this week. I had an issue with the lock box and the key, but Gregg was very responsive and solved the issue in a matter of seconds."
9501054,138395133,2017-03-19,109405001,Diana,Nice room

9501054,141903229,2017-04-05,121618399,Lena,Greg är mycket tillmötesgående och snabb att kommunicera. Prisvärt boende nära centrala staden.
9501054,142494839,2017-04-08,53858771,Patricia,"Very nice place with everything that is important a clean comfortable bed, clean and hot shower and large quiet room. Located in a nice brownstone the room is on the street level. <br/>I was able to park on the street in front of the building but the spaces are limited. Gregg offer a garage around the block but I did not use it.<br/>Gregg was quick to answer any questions and the entire stay was pleasant."
9501054,147801875,2017-04-28,109502970,Justin,Everything as expected and Gregg was very helpful
9501054,147998443,2017-04-29,127964000,Andrew,Great place. Quiet with blackout curtains.
9501054,150855186,2017-05-09,13708762,Tyler,Great!
9501054,151048877,2017-05-10,124100465,Kristopher,"The place is in a great location, close to museum, concourse, egg etc. The price was good also for 1 room and shared bathroom. There were others staying there but we didn't bother each other since the place is big enough for multiple tenants and we had our own space. If I ever go up there again I'll stay here again if available."
9501054,151957210,2017-05-14,10785886,Charlie,It was a very basic room but Gregg was very pleasant and it was easy enough to get in/out.
9501054,154672309,2017-05-25,19899614,Evan,Greg was very helpful and accommodating. Great proximity to the Albany Capital Center and plenty of cool local eats and drinks nearby.
9501054,155204459,2017-05-27,33246439,Amanda,"Spacious room and very quiet. It has everything you might need for a few days - mini frigde, microwave, tv. I didn't meet Gregg in person, but he was quick on the response when I needed. <br/>Good location to walk around!"

9501054,160326765,2017-06-13,128761164,Yurong,It's in a lovely neighborhood and Gregg has been very nice.
9501054,160540174,2017-06-14,132876586,Qinghao,"It's an unforgettable living.I arrive in 11:50PM and I cannot find keys.Mr.greg is very helpful and patient,the room is clean and safe,the bathroom is perfect.Its a perfect house!"
9501054,164266235,2017-06-26,86671157,Andrew John,"Cons: old property, poor lighting.<br/>Pros: unbeatable price and location in downtown Albany"
9501054,164727358,2017-06-29,81550635,Qianwen,Greg is a great host! Very responsive and friendly! It's a nice experience! 
9501054,168486668,2017-07-09,128885280,Devin,"Gregg was highly responsive to any questions I had, and check-in was fine. The location is also good, close to eateries, the New York State Museum, the Empire State Plaza (and therefore, access to numerous bus routes), and just a short drive to the Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak station. <br/>However, the level of cleanliness was rather disappointing, to the point where I am unlikely to return the next time I stay in Albany. The refrigerator was not clean. The bed appeared half-made. The room was a bit musty, and the entry hallway was very musty. <br/>I would discourage anyone with allergies from booking this room, due to the carpet. I thought I had grown out of mine, as I haven't stayed in a house with carpet since I was 12 or 13, but my nose ran for almost my entire stay, and my left eye was watery and irritated until about a half hour after I left. "
9501054,172696369,2017-07-21,62210039,Gong,Great!
9501054,174065541,2017-07-24,9152445,Marshall,"Stayed for one night. Easy check in. Central location. Room was larger than expected with mini fridge, ironing board, coffee, towel, and an extra bed."
9501054,174642422,2017-07-26,12667455,Ian,Awesome location for taking the bar exam; a five minute walk to the Convention Center (Empire State Plaza).
9501054,175755443,2017-07-29,74177,Richard,Great location for exploring the Capital Plaza. Easy walking to interesting nearby neighborhoods including a selection of eateries. <br/>Easy making arrangements with Gregg with quick responses from him. Large ground-level room with a nice bed. A great find for my one-night stay in Albany.
9501054,177368186,2017-08-02,138224169,Sophie,"Très grande chambre proche du centre ville à pied. Greg a pu m obtenir un pass résident pour me garer dans la rue sans frais, c était super. Frigo, microonde, sèche cheveux, serviette, savon,   Repassage, TV, bref tout y est! Super , merci .sophie "
9501054,177732134,2017-08-03,9859167,Patrick,Everything was as expected. It was cost effective and great for a quick night
9501054,180537368,2017-08-10,31809039,Gregory,Great Location
9501054,181980620,2017-08-13,141153317,Mac,"This was a great central location in an old Albany home. It was very cozy and clean, and Gregg was super responsive whenever I had any questions. Check-in was super easy and the price can't be beat. I recommend using taxis when traveling to and from this location late at night, but during the day and early evening it feels very safe. Highly recommended, I would definitely stay here again!"
9501054,186114107,2017-08-23,14389089,Maria Eugenia Grillet,"I stayed in a very confortable and spacious room with all the necessary facilities (wifi,cable tv,fridge,iron,etc). Clean and quiet place. Very well located and close to downtown and the historical center of Albany. It is a worthy place to stay. The host was very kind and always comunicative. Highly recommended place."

9501054,192526392,2017-09-10,16218383,Coline,Fine place for a short stay! Gregg was easy to communicate with and everything went great!
9501054,193185810,2017-09-12,25205092,Madeline,"Gregg communicates well with his guests. He clearly described how to get into the apartment and I had no problems with check in/check out. <br/>The apartment is on the older side, but the room was clean and had everything a guest could need: an iron, coffee and coffee maker, a fridge, a desk, a TV, etc. I appreciated that I had a key to lock the door to my room. <br/>I stayed in a downstairs room and I shared a bathroom with other guests. I saw some other reviews that described a shower in a closet with a nonlocking door, but I didn't encounter that. The downstairs bathroom was a normal bathroom with a shower and toilet and had a door with a working lock."
9501054,196546590,2017-09-23,2432250,Brian,Thanks for the help letting me have packages delivered! Only 1 block from museum!

9501054,197950034,2017-09-27,26263899,Scott,"Greg was very available as a host and the price of the room is a good deal. That being said, the location,although near State Capital, is a bit sketchy. I would not walk alone at night"
9501054,198783020,2017-09-30,2432250,Brian,Close to some nice bars and closest airbnb to the museum. Easy-peasy checkin. Gregg is friendly.
9501054,199233019,2017-10-01,134599418,Steven,great! thank you.
9501054,199662564,2017-10-02,127422287,Christopher,"The room was very generous and the space was clean. The building itself was a bit old, as are most of the architecture in the area, but the space inside was just fine. Gregg was very responsive, often responding back to me within a minute of my message. I didn't have problem with parking, but I might have gotten lucky since I got the last spot on the street when I came back at around 9pm-ish. The doorknob to the front door didn't work, but he makes up for that by having 2 bolt locks, so I didn't necessarily feel unsafe."
9501054,200493327,2017-10-05,95480193,Carl,"I just want to tell you all that Greg's place is amazing the room I stayed in was quite immaculate the house is beautiful and  I pretty much had everything I needed in my room . Great was very helpful in helping me to find the apartment which is located in a great area very beautiful area within walking distance to the library ,The egg and the number 114 into 14 buses that run throughout the city into the rendealer train station . The bus stop is  right across the street from the  House there are several restaurants in each direction and if you are a professional needing to access the capital area  oratory us looking to sightsee you could not pick a better house or location they're also of course Cabs frequent this area"
9501054,201095597,2017-10-07,143000865,Jesse,Gregg was very helpful and accommodating. Had the pleasure of running into him as I was leaving and he was very friendly. The place was great and easy to access.

I was here for one night before an interview, and would definitely recommend it to others in a similar situation."
9501054,212165400,2017-11-16,133649035,Sam,"The room was clean and comfortable, and everything went seamlessly. The location was pretty convenient for me, close to the Empire State Plaza and only a 15-minute or so walk to all sorts of restaurants and cafes on Lark Street. I would definitely recommend staying at Gregg's place. Thanks again!"

9501054,223043178,2017-12-31,56328487,Maxine,"My friend and I stayed here for one night for a wedding nearby. It's a good place to stay for one-two nights. Nothing fancy, just clean, comfy beds, and a clean bathroom down the hall that's shared with the AirBnB rental. The room has a fridge, blow-dryer, coffee, etc, which we didn't need to use. It is a little bit dark, but if you're not planning on spending the entire day there, then it's fine; there are also two extra lamps in the room if you want it a bit brighter. You'll definitely have to go the bathroom if you're doing make-up. The location is great, and Gregg is super responsive."

9501054,225192419,2018-01-05,129903331,Anish,"Great place, reasonable price.<br/>Difficult to find the entrance initially, but found it. You need to go under the main entrance to the house via the side"
9501054,225456461,2018-01-06,39046353,Robert,"Exactly as advertised. Quiet, clean, comfortable and warm. I stayed for a quick night (late in and early out) and it was perfect for me."

9501054,232338300,2018-02-04,57754370,James,"Greg was very responsive to communication. His place is literally 2-3 blocks to Time Union Center, which was perfect for us. His place is on the lower level of his house, so you don't have to interrupt him while coming/going. The bed was cozy, and the shower pressure was on point! Just a small mess in the hallway, but it was probably just recent, and it didn't bother us too much. Definately looking forward to coming back."

9501054,243937179,2018-03-17,46216782,Jon & Nicole,"Very nice place in the heart of Albany. We had a small issue at check in, but Gregg was there in less than 10 minutes to take care of it. Can't ask for much more. I would definitely recommend this place."
9501054,245474514,2018-03-22,3406819,Smita,Gregg's place is in a great location and he was a kind host who responded quickly any time I got in touch.  Thanks Gregg!
9501054,246878625,2018-03-26,78840862,Jim,"Really is a HUGE room. Very clean. Fridge & microwave, good internet, work space with desk. <br/> On a winter weekend with temps in the 30s & low 40s, it was  a little chilly in the room. Space heater available, but not large enough to compensate for little or nothing from radiators. <br/>Parking was as promised (""plenty on the street nearby"") Friday & Saturday, but a nightmare on Sunday, when only residents are allowed to park for more than 2 hours on weekdays. And finding a space Sunday night was a only by luck within a 6 block area. You're good if it's only a weekend. Weekdays, no."
9501054,248086998,2018-03-30,175150256,Eric,"Great place for the price. Room was spacious and the bed was large comfortable. I did not get to interact personally with Gregg on this stay but he was quick to respond to my questions and concerns. Nice amenities included: refrigerator, microwave, coffee machine, blow dryer, a wide selection of toiletries... The neighbourhood and the house could be updated but was good for my stay. Would come back if I am in the area alone some time in the future."
9501054,250272956,2018-04-04,181124646,Damone,Very close to events
9501054,251789307,2018-04-08,134860139,Renata,"This was close to the venue we went to see a concert at. However the carpets clearly hadn’t been vacuumed. There was an ear plug, gummy, and sock on the floor. And there was a mess when we first walked into the apartment. Probably wouldn’t stay again."
9501054,252427324,2018-04-10,66263043,Rachael,"The room was extremely clean and organized when I arrived.  If you are looking for a convenient but homey location in Albany, Gregg's place is the way to go! It was also a huge benefit that Gregg responds promptly with any questions you have."
9501054,253239806,2018-04-13,10262858,Trudy,"Unfortunately had to cancel trip last minute due to a family emergency, but prior to that Gregg was super communicative with relevant information!"
9501054,254043834,2018-04-15,35740147,Macy,"Great place for a short stay. Sheets and towels were very clean and the shower was amazing. Furniture and bathroom fixtures were a little grimy, however, and the room smelled musty when I entered. But I’m a stickler for cleanliness and my standards might be higher than the average person’s. Overall, would recommend."
9501054,254669549,2018-04-17,148442858,Asif,Awesome stay. Very comfortable. Gregg was a great host.
9501054,256734778,2018-04-23,4157310,Katie,"The location and price can't be beat, but it was a bit off from what I expected! Namely that it is sort of a large basement area: you enter a large, long hallway and there are a few rooms with a shared bathroom down the hall. There was also another guest staying in one of the other rooms; we did not interact but that was certainly a surprise. Also lots of items in the hall, so that might bother some folks, but the room has less ""stuff"" in it."
9501054,257033717,2018-04-24,67982632,Hannah,"Very quick walk to the Convention Center, the Egg, and restaurants. Amenities also include a hair dryer, iron & ironing board."
9501054,257283294,2018-04-25,34983431,Jonathan,Great stay! Nice room at a good price.
9501054,258158864,2018-04-28,19331872,Timothy,Gregg made visiting Albany very easy.  Check in and out was well detailed and easy.  The room was very clean and cozy.  The value was very good and the whole experience effortless.  Thank you to Gregg for a great stay.
9501054,260342584,2018-05-04,43599013,Josh,Gregg’s place was easy to find and easy to get in. The room was large bathroom on same level. Solid value.
9501054,260625812,2018-05-04,37817989,Ilene,This is a great value. I texted Gregg about the WiFi and since he was upstairs he immediately came down to answer my question. He is a very nice host.<br/>The price is low so I didn’t expect luxury accommodations. I got what was advertised and was pleased. And the bed was comfortable.
9501054,262366977,2018-05-08,166994373,Michael,"The room is in a nice historical stretch of homes on Madison Place. The room was enormous, and would be great for 2-3 people. Coffee was available. The television was small. Great value for what I paid."
9501054,265588551,2018-05-17,7682873,Toni,"If you have business in Albany, Gregg's place is perfect & he's very communicates in a timely fashion. While the front room is huge, the decor is a bit dated & the front entrance cluttered."
9501054,266703556,2018-05-20,119492135,Shelley,Excellent communication!  Responds quickly!  Quiet place!  Walking distance to lots of restaurants and venues!  I recommend Gregg!
9501054,267437598,2018-05-21,148442858,Asif,Always a pleasure staying at Greggs place.
9501054,267750952,2018-05-22,153971557,Mark,Great host and helpful tips for local restaurants and transport.
9501054,268036389,2018-05-23,26431902,Dawud,Cheap place to stay for the night
9501054,268346341,2018-05-24,106824740,Marta Laufey,It was nice staying there. And very close to the city center.
9501054,270613122,2018-05-29,55328468,Shitao,"Central location, very spacious bedroom, clean bathroom, quiet neighborhood, definitely worth the price. "
9501054,273305700,2018-06-05,91110406,Steve,Wonder clean comfy space walking distance from capital buildings. Incredible value. Thank you.
9501054,273866293,2018-06-07,180651526,Rodrigo,Greg is very clear in his communication. I recommend.
9501054,275234163,2018-06-10,76917631,Carl,"clean, compact, and close to downtown!"
9501054,277544673,2018-06-16,35468370,Leah,Just like it was described. Place was nice and clean.  Right in downtown. Great for a stay if you are visiting the area
9501054,278207340,2018-06-17,34864817,Eddie,Central location and nice apartment. Great for any business you have in Albany
9501054,279048727,2018-06-19,1486879,Bob,This was my second time staying  in one of Gregg’s places.  All was great.   I recommend it.
9501054,279765009,2018-06-21,94728649,Carolin,Gregg is a very nice host who it was easy to communicate with.  I stayed there for a night because it's very close to the greyhound bus terminal. The room is great and there is even a fridge and coffee. I would recommend this place.
9501054,280546223,2018-06-23,11687868,Laurent,This place is well situated to major touristic spots but feels like being on the edge of the inner city.<br/>The sound isolation isn't very good. Bring earplugs in case you have noisy neighbors.
9501054,281264513,2018-06-24,130822857,Jonathan,Never met Gregg but my stay was just what I was looking for.
9501054,282886074,2018-06-28,9621851,Ally,"Fantastically located. I had to spend a lot of time at the Egg while in Albany and it was just a 7-minute walk away. It’s an old building (like most residential buildings in the area seem to be), but the room was spacious and cleanliness was not an issue. Check-in/out was super convenient and the experience was seamless."
9501054,284433108,2018-07-01,175237659,John,"Room is large and great downtown location, but there is no air conditioning. Small TV in room but reception is poor. Good value."
9501054,285000870,2018-07-02,24303560,Ying,It's a great stay. Quiet and clean. Gregg is a great host!
9501054,286098707,2018-07-05,193115452,Marie,"We stayed at Gregg's on the Fourth of July. Even though it was a holiday, we were able to park in front of the building. It is within walking distance to Empire Plaza, the Cathedral and the Hill Street Cafe. The room is on the first floor and it is large and comfortable. The common area is somewhat cluttered. Gregg was hospitable and helpful with local tips and there was adequate communication. The building was built in 1846. We enjoyed the stay and would recommend, especially if you like historic buildings."
9501054,287113308,2018-07-07,100236071,Marianne,"Great location, spacious room and easy check-in and check-out process. Thanks!"
9501054,287825024,2018-07-08,2289006,Ward,"Decent room in a beautiful row of houses, very close to State House Plaza. Gregg is a friendly host and offered us a welcome drink."
9501054,288311551,2018-07-09,149825979,Cordez,"Nice apartment, great amenities, great host."
9501054,290000692,2018-07-13,80865146,Frank,Great space super convenient and Gregg was very nice.
9501054,290493739,2018-07-14,200508556,Tasha,"This is a nice space and was well suited for our needs. It isn’t air conditioned, which usually wouldn’t matter, but it was hot during our stay. A small fan was provided, but a longer extension cord would be helpful to blow the air on the bed. It’s been unseasonably hot, so this would not usually be an issue. My daughter stayed here in winter and it was cozy. I recommend it! The shower was nice! Also I recommend a visit to Cider Belly doughnuts if you can!"
9501054,291818533,2018-07-16,175014590,Jeffrey,"Didn’t end up staying. Was greeted by an army of flies and stench from trash cans under the stairs when I walked to the door. Room had a weird dingy vibe, felt unwelcoming. The neighborhood did not feel like a safe place to walk around even in the daytime. The reviews and photos made it seem miles better than it was. I didn’t even want to chance staying. I have message Gregg and he hasn’t responded at all."
9501054,292244179,2018-07-17,73104577,Jeremy,Great neighborhood and location 
9501054,292708867,2018-07-18,251849,Alice,Easy check in with lock box. Big comfy bed. Glad I picked this place.
9501054,293589477,2018-07-20,155728342,Maryam,"Room was just as advertised, roomy and welcoming. Very convenient location, and Gregg is a great host, responsive and flexible. "
9501054,294135510,2018-07-21,181108509,Nicholas,Always a great hospitality experience at Gregg’s Historic Albany home. Thanks again!
9501054,295440335,2018-07-23,34068150,Yanjiao,location was very central. gregg was also super responsive. very pleasant stay
9501054,299764725,2018-07-31,58521079,Drew,"As described. The room is a charming historical building, facing the New York State government buildings and in an up and coming neighborhood, bustling with rejuvenation. The room looks exactly as seen in the pictures. Gregg has a beautifully decorated room, with many interesting art pieces on the wall and has balanced the images nicely to create a comfortable space for any guest who loves art and history. Easy and convenient, Gregg took care of my parking and made my stop over in Albany a breeze. Also, everything was very clean. Great place to stay."
9501054,300650350,2018-08-02,83786161,Cristián,"Great place to stay, perfect location close to all the best places to go in Albany.  Recommend it a 100%"
9501054,301087347,2018-08-03,67895874,Steve,The place was in a great location near downtown and it was easy to get into. 
9501054,305007224,2018-08-10,117984394,Nicolas,"Big room, plenty of amenities, cheap, friendly host, great local wings in the area; the hallmarks of a great overnight stay in Albany. Thanks Gregg!"
9501054,305675547,2018-08-11,28765549,Travis,"As others have said, the location and price are awesome.  More than that, Greg is a relaxed, kind guy and the large, cozy room is full of neat historical furniture and items.  You feel like you are in a different time.  Some of the old doors and windows need a little patience but everything works great and you have all you need including a modern TV and mini fridge if you desire.  There is free street parking.  Just give Greg your plate information beforehand.  Thanks for a special time Greg.  God bless your family.  Wish I could have stayed longer.  "
9501054,306313169,2018-08-12,33295219,Kristofor,Great place when in a pinch. 
9501054,307082723,2018-08-13,51097,Paul,Gregg’s Place is remarkably close to the Empire Plaza where you can take a tour of the capital and of the plaza. He’s across the street from the governors Mansion and an historic church. Ask Greg about local history. <br/>The bathroom is shared. The room is aesthetic. <br/>Value is great!
9501054,308008849,2018-08-15,49992363,Marissa,"While the price and location are hard to beat, and the host is generally a great communicator, I would not recommend booking here. The trash bins right outside the door attract tons of flies and mosquitos which entered the property along with me, no matter how quickly I tried to close the door. There was an overpoweringly dank, animal-like odor in the bedroom and the lack of AC made for an extremely uncomfortable night’s sleep. The clutter in the entryway is not only unwelcoming but off-putting and frankly bizarre (it includes a number of dirty papers, personal photographs, coins, and random household objects like WD-40). Lastly, there was no shampoo or conditioner and the towel smelled moldy. Ultimately, not worth the bargain."
9501054,308503361,2018-08-16,5602332,Fabian,"Host was very fast responding, easy check-in, nice room "
9501054,311107694,2018-08-20,201405523,Chloe,"Good place to stay for the night. Not the location we expected, it was quite scary walking around the area. Bedroom was spacious, clean and comfortable. We had issues where we were woken at night by someone shouting and banging the door but it was soon resolved. Overall good place to stay for the price."
9501054,313013355,2018-08-24,134956450,Sydney,"Excellent location, nearly guaranteed parking, drink and food nearby,  lovely street with a fountain.  "
9501054,314222853,2018-08-26,91200975,Julia,Appreciate this short stay at this convenient location. Gregg is a really nice host!
9501054,314954229,2018-08-27,39754514,Stephanie,Comfortable space and super convenient location.  
9501054,315400697,2018-08-28,211325440,Alex,Great value and super convenient for where I needed to go. This was my first Airbnb so I'm pleased!
9501054,316146410,2018-08-30,11868171,Paul,As advertised.
9501054,316566539,2018-08-31,209614572,Karen,"Within walking distance  to all Albany capital sights, museums and the concourse."
9501054,317748475,2018-09-02,65826075,Douglas,the place was great and Gregg provided everything that I needed
9501054,319164300,2018-09-05,51340190,Duncan,"Gregg is extremely responsive, and his rooms are beautiful in addition to being located in a great place downtown if you want to walk and see what Albany has to offer. I would gladly book this place again in the future."
9501054,321038618,2018-09-09,191226091,Krishna,"Gregg's place is great value for money! The best thing about the place is the mattress which is nice and hard, and provides peaceful sleep."
9501054,327260023,2018-09-23,107476804,Timo,"Convenient location, good price, and all the basic necessities."
9501054,328271405,2018-09-25,19421557,Ricardo,I visited Albany to go to a conference and this place was perfect for me. It was very nice and quiet at a walking distance from the conference center.
9501054,328588954,2018-09-26,148428705,Sandra,"The room was exactly what I expected. Everything was extremely clean and the room has lots of space! There was a little noise from the people who live above, but nothing major. I slept very soundly. The shower has excellent water pressure! I always feel that’s worth noting. There’s convenient street parking out front. I didn’t have a problem finding a space. I didn’t see Gregg, but he responded very quickly. The location is great if you’re interested in visiting the Empire State Plaza, State House, and the USS Slater. This was my first trip to Albany and I would definitely stay here again. <br/>Also, if you’re looking for a great breakfast/lunch place, try Iron Gate Cafe. So good!!! It’s about a 5 minute drive away."
9501054,329747247,2018-09-29,182417189,Malia,great place in Albany
9501054,330413378,2018-09-30,66016894,Marlon,Nice room in top location! Definitely recommend!
9501054,331063859,2018-10-01,212047554,Hamed,"I would definitely recommend this place to folks on Airbnb. Very clean. Great service. Great location. Friendly neighborhood. Ease access to public transportation. Follow the instructions and you’re 100% fine. At first i had trouble finding the wifi pass. I was about to text Gregg, till i realized it was written on a note inside the room."
9501054,332137763,2018-10-04,33259927,Daniela,"Greggs flat fits perfectly to Albany. We had a great stay, everything was clean and Gregg help with a parking slot and very fast answers. I would definitely recommend to stay there."
9501054,334938942,2018-10-10,54987893,Poppa,Expect warm reception and cozy environment.....
9501054,335583501,2018-10-12,200845312,Raj,Great bed! Didn’t stay for very long.
9501054,336660004,2018-10-14,60355945,Lara,"Awesome! Great location, and communication with Gregg was fast and easy. I really appreciated his flexibility in letting me check in early after a long flight. Would definitely recommend!"
9501054,340039939,2018-10-22,209289335,Francesco,"Ottima posizione, buon prezzo"
9501054,341290633,2018-10-26,30851406,Hannah,"Convenient location, very short walk to all the things to see in Albany. The room was big too and can comfortably fit 3 people since there’s an extra bed. I never met Gregg but check-in and check-out was easy. Thanks."
9501054,342231370,2018-10-28,32574264,Julie,"It is an old house which means imperfections but also a unique charm. I really enjoyed the antiquish feel and decor, especially the enormous bed. The room is large and  comfortable, with a desk and a working desk chair (which I really appreciate), an armchair, fridge, microwave. A twin bed as well as the big bed which is at least a queen, maybe a king.  Enough space that three friends could comfortably share it. TV only has a few channels and it's small, but hey I don't expect any TV at an inexpensive airbnb, it's a little bonus. If there was any drawback it was having no outlet close to the bed for phone charging; I bought a $10 extension cord for my stay. Bathroom down the hall is shared with another room but I never even saw the other guests. Bathroom clean with shampoo and lots of hot water. The guest rooms are on the ground floor, accessed under the front steps so there is privacy. Each room has a lockbox for easy check in. Some reviews noted there is stuff in the hallway and there is, but it's really not a big deal, it's just some shelves with random stuff on them, not massive clutter.  The location is easy walking distance from the convention center and arena, downtown and the capitol, though it is just on the other side of the expressway. There are boarded up buildings in the area and someone unaccustomed to an urban neighborhood might be uncomfortable but I never felt unsafe as a single woman, even walking back fairly late. There's a nice dive bar half a block down the hill, and a fun, cheap diner (Betty Boop's) a few blocks away. If I ever have reason to visit downtown Albany again I will absolutely book with Gregg again."
9501054,344027326,2018-11-02,44851919,Ian,"Great value. Big room! Super clean, and great location."
9501054,346390092,2018-11-08,6414287,Stephen,"Excellent value for money, a short walk from the capital and conference centers. Easy in and out!"
9501054,346715514,2018-11-09,224073401,Justine,This was my first experience with Airbnb and I was thoroughly impressed.  I had the best night sleep I’ve had in a while.  Thank you for the quiet solitude!
9501054,347630827,2018-11-11,147189885,Britt,This is my 2nd stay at Gregg's place. I had a great stay as expected. Would def recommend staying here.
9501054,349143509,2018-11-16,10472539,Woody,Ideal location for exploring Albany. Immaculately clean bedroom and bathroom in beautiful home.
9501054,350146870,2018-11-18,37920690,Cindy & Marv,"Nice place and good location. When we stayed there, there was a lot of noise from the other guests/residents. But when you don't have that, it's perfect! Bathroom and room was reallly nice."
9501054,350541370,2018-11-19,65308984,Shaham,"Although not met Gregg personally, but he was available through message. Give prompt reply. Space was clean, big large room, even 3 people can stay. Bathroom was shared. Although there was no Kitchen but space is great if you eat outside. Love this place."
9501054,351979099,2018-11-24,199493943,Shawn,"Comfy bed, great location to downtown.  Would definitely recommend and book again!! Thank you"
9501054,352640937,2018-11-25,183126413,Paul,Gregg is a great host. He was very prompt with his directions and his responses. The location was perfect for what I needed. I would gladly stay here again if I find myself traveling to Albany.
9501054,353564651,2018-11-28,3619047,Loren,Awesome space! will absolutely stay again
9501054,355740374,2018-12-05,42697349,James,"Gregg was a terrific host and the room was great for everything, i.e. comfortable, location, amenities, etc. I stayed a week and highly recommend it if traveling to Albany."
9501054,356226997,2018-12-07,29897410,Ninad,"Great value for the price. Place is near the major building, but street parking (even on a Thursday night) was not as accessible as described; had to park around the corner and walk which was not the biggest deal but wanted to point out to future guests. The room is spacious, large and the bed is comfortable. No cable, but WiFi connectivity is great.<br/>There was coffee and coffee pot left but no water anywhere, and no taps (other than the bathroom) to grab it from. I did not feel comfortable just taking water from the bathroom tap, especially for drinking purposes but for the value, it was a great quick stay. I went there for a job interview, so needed a place to crash for the night, iron my suit and shirt and shower in the morning before heading out."

9501054,560665731,2019-11-07,22400280,Nadine,Chambre un peu sombre et la propreté laisse un peu à désirer.
9501054,590083505,2020-01-07,46411033,Mohammad,Nice place. When getting into your room you have to enter the door under the stairs. Big room. Bathroom is shared. Entrance is a little bit messy.
9501054,598052856,2020-01-26,329957202,Kamrun,Close to the Capital Center and City Hall. Very convenient location!
9501054,603746008,2020-02-09,179974004,Misaki,It’s really cold inside because heaters are not strong. Also you can hear everything from upstairs so probably the host can hear you too

9501054,739850952,2021-03-17,3901215,Gopi,"Gregg is very quick to respond and place is decent, I had a good stay. Only difficult part was finding Parking."
9501054,743793849,2021-03-30,379713978,Candice,"As a traveler it is often difficult to settle in to new areas. Greg made that process easy. He assisted obtaining parking pass, he was always only a text away and responded quickly. The apartment was clean and had amenities as listed. Parking was easy to find on street ( bearing street rules in mind). Greg was generous enough and ensured I only paid for the night stayed. ( I was cancelled last minute from working hence checked out early). <br/> I would recommend this location to anyone working on close by or just visiting. <br/>Thanks again Greg!"
9501054,746835260,2021-04-08,372344274,Braden,"Large space with comfortable furnishings. Convenient if you have business downtown Albany, and Gregg makes the process smooth and easy"
9501054,757053968,2021-05-10,4414195,Randolph And Snezhana,"The very large room is in the half-basement of a gracious four-story home on a tree-lined block developed in 1848 in a neighborhood now called The Mansions. The space, though not as plush or polished as the exterior, is comfortable and  quiet. The location is wonderful, a half-block from the cathedral and a five-minute walk from the Rockefeller Empire State Plaza and the state capitol.   A good value."
9501054,770561751,2021-06-14,134932374,Skylar,We stayed at Gregg’s place for two nights while escaping the bustle of the city. It was a good base for us to explore Albany and other places. We ended up spending a day in Lake George. The room was as advertised and was very quiet which we appreciated!
9501054,418041202556802776,2021-07-30,213989099,Meghan,"Good location, good communication, gracious hosts,  easy check-in/check-out. Great value!"

9501054,430329210954829830,2021-08-16,265924569,Syeda,"The apartment is in a basement. It smelled absolutely horrible. It was humid and muggy. The windows were sealed shut so you couldn’t open them. To top it off, there was carpet everywhere in the room in a BASEMENT unit which added to smell. Like why would you put carpet. There’s only one overhead light which is not bright off. One small container for water which ran out in 3 hours. do yourself a favor, do not stay here."
9501054,434726423994593337,2021-08-22,38963245,Matthew,"My recommendation for anyone who is considering this place would be to look very carefully at the indoor pics, and to read the both the positive and negative reviews. <br/>I found the room to be stuffy and dirty, and honestly a little scary."
9501054,436213900976766666,2021-08-24,404852644,Errico,"This is a great place. I found the room to be very spacious and comfortable. Gregg is a great host, he responded very quickly to all my messages and gave great advice about the surrounding area!"
9501054,442730678639379270,2021-09-02,77326710,Spencer,Great spot very clean Greg is wonderful can’t say enough good things about him
9501054,447733657478225364,2021-09-09,116401390,Ticia,"I really can't say enough about what a great little place this is. The houses on Madison place are all such gorgeous historic homes and Gregg's is not an exception. It is so gracious of him to open his home to people and allow them to experience some of this history. <br/>The location is amazing and located across from a small lovely park and less than a block from the Empire State Plaza as well as walking distance from both Lark st and downtown Albany. The room is lovely and very tidy. The bed super comfy and the attached bathroom very clean and all you need for your stay. There is also a small refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker, dishes, utensils and bottled water (though Albany has great drinking water so that is just an amenity). There is a lovely antique sofa as well as other chairs for lounging. It was super easy to get in w/ the instructions that Gregg provided. <br/>I am quite baffled by the bad reviews that a couple of other people gave. There was most certainly no bad smells, it was not musty at all. It is a first floor walk in but not moist (and having lived in Albany for over 20 years I know that we have an excess of water so that is definitely a possibility). The person that mentioned creepy I feel has a very skewed view of the word creepy. It is charming and an amazing steal for anyplace. What it is Not is a new and austere hotel room. If that is what you are looking for then you probably should not be looking for an airbnb and just go to a hotel. <br/>I will be recommending this for all family and friends that are visiting the area (our bathroom is on the 2nd floor in our house so some of the elderly have some issues staying with us) and can't wait to see Gregg's other place!"
9501054,449169291281271676,2021-09-11,10266242,Armand,Great place and value. Perfect spot. Gregg was on top with communicating.

9501054,454264360114371253,2021-09-18,404506885,Richard,"Very comfortable and quiet flat.  Centrally located and within walking distance to the Empire State Plaza, downtown and Lark Street areas.  Gregg was very helpful in answering any questions.  We'd highly recommend his flat as a great place to stay in Albany."

9501054,460038192385576422,2021-09-26,97653726,Cindy,Spacious room with some nice antiques. Conveniently located on a pretty block with other historic homes. Definitely a good value for the money.
9501054,465130011820889569,2021-10-03,109716415,Sarah,"This was exactly what I needed when I came to Albany on business. It's central, not too far from the airport, and quiet. The bed is extremely comfortable, and the shower is warm without needing to wait for the water to heat up. Would recommend  anyone, especially others here on business."
9501054,467384226396478903,2021-10-06,404852644,Errico,Greg responds to email very quickly. His rental is a beautiful spacious room!

Parking can sometimes be a challenge but that's just the nature of the city and of no fault of the owner. Greg was very communicative and answered all my questions in a quick and concise manner.  definitely a nice space for the price"

It had a strong wifi connection, fridge, microwave, coffee pot, and everything I needed for my stay. The price was perfect and the location couldn't be beat!"
9501054,602147431942922219,2022-04-10,247312260,Marcos,I had a great experience with the host very kind and accommodates with the gust time!

9501054,615908227232144681,2022-04-29,129022501,Edward,Greggs was a private space in the basement of the building. I especially appreciated the room's private bathroom. Decent place to stay for anyone visiting Albany NY.
9501054,617322694793593209,2022-05-01,452769712,Lily,Great stay cozy little place
9501054,618757118392105683,2022-05-03,35067030,Anurag,"Greg's place is good for anyone looking to visit Albany for a couple of days and wants to be walking distance to the capitol and other areas. The location is unbeatable: it's a five minute walk to the government plaza. The place itself is also clean, spacious, and comfortable. The only potential issue would be that this is a basement/street level room. This isn't necessarily an issue, but it could be properly highlighted in the listing for people who might want to know.<br/>And finally, there is a gap when you enter the house that is not apparent. Anyone needing accommodations might want to be careful with this. For able-bodies people, this is a non-issue."
9501054,620228872969428301,2022-05-05,138958388,Derrick,Great place and location! Gregg was very friendly and communicative!

We were able to park right in front of the building and pretty much everything downtown is within in walking distance.<br/>Easy check-in, very comfortable bed and a good shower. There's also a fridge, microwave and some plates and cutlery in case you want to warm up food. Communication with Gregg was quick and easy."

9501054,660078076675990943,2022-06-29,180020509,Sarorn,"Easy place to get to with parking right out front. Nice comfortable big bed and very good AC. Bathroom didn't have a lock on it, which was fine for me since I was by myself. I could hear noises from outside but it wasn't terrible. Be warned of the parking outside and read the signs carefully."
9501054,672421555221154197,2022-07-16,43356439,Matt,"This is simply one of the best AirBNB that I’ve had! I’m so glad I’ve booked here!<br/>I think that Gregg’s place located on the best location in Albany. It is right in the center, in a walking distance to the state capital, and Albany world-class museum (less than 5 min!). It is on a side street so the traffic won’t bother you at all.<br/>The room itself has everything I needed and more! (Mini refrigerator, coffee machine, microwave, toaster oven, cutlery, dishes). Very spacious! (unlike many other AirBNB that I’ve had).<br/>The bed is extremely comfortable with many pillows!!!<br/>Needless to say there were always hot water in the shower. <br/>Also there are more than one couch and an extra bed.<br/>It was very clean when I arrived and It is decorated so nicely,  I liked the images on the wall, they really make you feel you are in a capital!<br/>This all shows that they really care for you in this AirBNB.<br/>I feel lucky to meet Gregg. We had a great conversation, he is very nice and  gave me some great tips.<br/>He also was always very responsive on text messaging.<br/>Albany is a great city, I’ve spent 3 days here and hope very much to come back. So many things to check out, Also nature-wise.<br/>Thank you Gregg for making this available and being so kind, helpful and accommodating.<br/>Bottom line, this is a great room in the best location in the city with a wonderful person like Gregg to make things easy for you.<br/>A+++, 5/5"
9501054,676076122536504859,2022-07-21,5002622,Jessica,"Quite nice and functional little place. Ac worked great when it was 97 out. Bed was comfy. Decor was amusing. Decent restaurants nearby. Easy access to Amtrak, greyhound and bus system."
9501054,682567689096635190,2022-07-30,452916598,Doug,"Greg has a very unique place to stay. It is an historic row home in downtown Albany. A short walk to many tourist sites, but realize that Albany has hills. The room is tastefully decorated and includes a mini-fridge, microwave, and toaster oven. The bathroom is small, but functional. It was hot outside, but the AC worked well. Greg turned it on before my arrival, so the room was quite comfortable when I got there.  Parking is on the street, but I had no trouble finding a place right in front. There was very little traffic on this one-way street with a small park across the street. Greg is very responsive - answering promptly on the two occasions I needed to contact him. I would recommend this to tourist and business travelers alike."
9501054,689104745706575025,2022-08-08,20490876,Madison,"Gregg was great and everything was very easy. Check in was simple and done by lockbox so timing didn't need to be coordinated. The room is large, well furnished, and conveniently located. There were lots of thoughtful amenities. It's on the garden level - the entrance is underneath the stairs leading to the main floor - so there isn't much natural light. The only real downside is that you can hear absolutely everything that goes on in the room next to you. Overall, a good place to stay in Albany."
9501054,704318484302457268,2022-08-29,22521879,Risa,"Perfectly in the middle of everything downtown! Gregg is responsive and very nice, highly recommend!"
9501054,705813619111197506,2022-08-31,159446286,Erica,great little single room in a house! right nearby the downtown and super accessible to mvp arena :) you can hear the street/upstairs but with the AC on it is a-ok
9501054,719521218624027999,2022-09-19,136256949,Tyler,Great stay and in a prime location. Gregg was very responsive.

9501054,727512438899208515,2022-09-30,211686198,Bente,"The spacious room was clean, mostly everything that’s needed was there. Only a basket or paper filter for the coffee machine was missing. Gregg answered every question very fast and was helpful. We could hear the neighbours, but since it is an old house it is relatable. The check-in and check-out was really easy and independent."
9501054,729012983118011275,2022-10-02,56259611,Dylan,"I visited Albany for the weekend and wanted a place to crash at near Downtown and Center Square. Gregg's suite is close to both and priced really fairly. There are two beds (one is big enough for two people, the other is like a day bed), and both were very comfortable. The place was quiet, and the entrance was easy to figure out from the host's directions.<br/>I recommend staying here if you're like me and just need a comfortable and quiet place to crash while spending your days out and about."
9501054,730452089856318925,2022-10-04,330226393,Chelsey,Awesome place to stay when spending a couple of days in town. Lots of space for only 2 people and very comfortable sleeping. 10/10 would stay again!
9501054,732595928275176726,2022-10-07,548775,Erin,"5 stars, it was exactly as I expected. I hope to stay again when I come back for another conference next year!"
9501054,734026019321626080,2022-10-09,14815170,Henish,Great location. Easy check-in. Gregg was responsive. No frills and has 1 bed and 1 day sleeper which were both very comfortable.
9501054,735497611485653247,2022-10-11,135065622,Eric,It was good!
9501054,749283145725376937,2022-10-30,6960233,Charlotte,"It's been said in the reviews before, but the ""free parking on premises"" is not truthful. There is only on-street parking, which on weekdays is limited to two hours (which Gregg can get you an exemption from). Regardless, like in many cities, especially downtown, a free spot isn't a given, so I had to search for quite a while until I found one a couple of blocks away. <br/>That's also due to the location, which I think is the nicest part about the place, it's really super central. The place is alright, and well-equipped for a short stay. It is quite dark, but thought is put into it to make it nice."
9501054,752162763634497517,2022-11-03,12834613,Richard,"Great place to say, good location, has all the essentials, good value"

9501054,794245382269708754,2022-12-31,335580511,David,Great location. Quiet and clean. Host helped with onsite parking. I would stay here again!
9501054,797097953787269260,2023-01-04,207731329,Chenghao,"Cool place just as described. The room is spacious, quiet, clean, cozy, and has everything in need. Perfect location, probably the closest place to the capitol you can find. Gregg is a nice host, always response quickly."
9501054,818905570618797487,2023-02-03,25278849,Zhu,POC’s beware.
9501054,824001670325636066,2023-02-10,498305466,Emani,"Ok let me say this. The location is great, the host is responsive and friendly. The pictures are exactly what you see. If you looking for crash pad that’s comfortable and affordable this is it. However the decor is very “Adams family vibe”. If you looking for convenience over luxury this is it. The room did get a little chilly but, its a heater provided. The bed is very comfortable. Is a little dark but its expected from the decor, i would recommend the host paint the walls white and remove the red carpet to brighten the space some. The bathroom was updated. Toilettes were provided. I think the host have a germ in this place if he spent a little to remodel it. i would stay again if it’s remodeled a little so it doesn’t feel so dark and cold."
9501054,828989900311886834,2023-02-17,500065827,Becky,"I really enjoyed my stay in Greg's home. The room was on the lowest level, which made it exceptionally quiet. I had my own entrance/exit from the building. <br/>The house is a historic row house on a lovely block of like homes. It's within walking distance of the places I needed to visit, which was important for me. The bed was amazingly comfortable! The bathroom was absolutely spotless.<br/>Gregg was a very accommodating host. He reached out to me a number of times, to be sure I had everything I needed. He helped me in a number of ways.<br/>I recommend Greg and his Air BnB highly!"
9501054,832662673329557257,2023-02-22,109907900,Nancy,"This is a great place to stay, especially if you are going to watch a show at the egg or have business at the Plaza. You can see the egg from the building the room is in. It is very clean and quiet. <br/>I went there to take the bar exam. If you are looking for an affordable place to stay this is!"
9501054,835593090965955940,2023-02-26,82136066,Jeffrey,"Nice, clean place wonderfully located. Will definitely stay again. Gregg was more than helpful when he learned that I had forgotten needed gear at home."
9501054,844265029540840114,2023-03-10,162895451,Pamela,"A very comfortable and cozy place in a convenient location—perfect for people who like quiet, tree-lined streets, and like taking a short walk to local places like the Library or the Plaza."
9501054,845708697704052286,2023-03-12,247312260,Marcos,"Amiable host, and the location is excellent around the capital"
9501054,847853894159746414,2023-03-15,65512814,Jon,Owner was very responsive with explaining on street parking and alternate sides rules. Made excellent recommendations for local places to eat.
9501054,850708713271893711,2023-03-19,29576250,Christopher,Gregg is  a great host and offers a great value for these  accommodations!  I would return for the next NCAA mbball tourney!  Thanks.
9501054,854308282601075226,2023-03-24,33698414,Thomas,"This is a fun place on a block of Victorian renovated townhouses. The room has the same feel with fridge, coffee and dishes not everyone supplies. Easy walk to Albany center and restaurants."
9501054,855782679153415690,2023-03-26,155815261,Michael,"Nice space, mostly convenient parking near by.<br/>Walking distance to the MVP Arena and a few restaurants and pubs.<br/>Really close to highway"
9501054,860160325821328102,2023-04-01,420004839,Jackelynn,"This is my second time staying at Gregg's, and like last time, I felt right at home. Gregg is an amazing host!"
9501054,871732979621407686,2023-04-17,160874252,Kim,"Very thoughtful set up: toaster oven, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, dishes, and though I did not use it, I noticed there was even a plug in electric stove. <br/>The bed was very comfortable and the host was kind enough to accommodate a late check out request."
9501054,875367650543676828,2023-04-22,162895451,Pamela,"Gregg is truly a super host. He’s thoughtful and takes care that his guests have a great stay. This is a convenient, clean, & quiet location. Five stars ⭐️"
9501054,880510602883650652,2023-04-29,213762919,Joe,I enjoyed my stay here better than my many business visits to the Hilton Albany and Renaissance Albany. I was able to park my car and walk to all of the important venues in the area. The unit is spacious and comfortable. I'm sure to look u Gregg again next time.
9501054,883344240087187794,2023-05-03,184133160,Hillary,"Great stay! I had a class at the State Archives and it was right around the corner to get there.  Also easy to walk to Lark Street, Pearl Street, and Washington Avenue. I really appreciated the dishes, fridge, microwave and coffee maker- along with having the option to easily walk to pubs, restaurants and coffee shops.  Thanks for the great stay, Gregg!"
9501054,886210116184640966,2023-05-07,167561679,Janet,"Convenient, comfortable. Basement apartment— not a lot of light but if you are using it just as a place to stay overnight and not particularly hang out, it’s great. Gregg was very responsive and friendly. Parking was easy. A great deal."
9501054,889881704477298864,2023-05-12,162895451,Pamela,Always a great stay. Thanks Gregg!

9501054,902189310587956867,2023-05-29,420371059,Camillo,"Cozy, charming room very close to Albany Downtown. Highly recommended for short-term stay!"
9501054,913750286861059950,2023-06-14,211526727,Detlef,The room was very clean and equipped with all things you need when you are on a longer journey. All attractions are in a near distance to the room and can be reached easily by walking. <br/>Gregg was very helpful and supported with several proposals for restaurants and attractions in town.
9501054,936998363586020034,2023-07-16,251000918,Paul,"Greg’s place is ideal for anyone traveling to Albany for the NY State Museum, or the state governmental offices, both of which are practically next door, as is the All Saints Cathedral. <br/>Parking is on-street and was a bit challenging, as there was a temporary no-parking order while we were there, so we ended up parking around the corner both nights we stayed. <br/>The room is large and comfortable with eclectic vintage furniture and decorations from the 19th and early 20th century. There’s a microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker, and hot plate, so it would be great for an extended stay. Gregg was responsive to our needs. <br/>The space does have a couple challenges: the bathroom door does not have a latch and doesn’t close fully. Additionally, for anyone traveling with small children, there is cracking lead paint in the bathroom and the radiators in the bedroom are exposed. While these issues weren’t problems for us, they might be for other travelers. <br/>All in all, we enjoyed our stay."
9501054,946413747183953721,2023-07-29,479826890,William,Greg was a great host and very responsive. The place is exactly what it looks like and there is a decent amount of space. I was able to work remote with no problem. Somewhat private lower entrance for ease of access. Parking is easy as long as you ask him to get you a pass for street parking. Good value compared to the hotels in the area and very close to a ton of walking attractions. Would recommend.
9501054,950704886991952697,2023-08-04,170587965,Ben,"This basement room was perfectly located for my week of research at the NY State archives, about a 5-minute walk away (or less).  The street parking is slightly competitive, but I always found a spot.  Also, Gregg added me for a temporary parking pass, so I was good to leave me car and walk. The place is more like a hotel room than an apartment - no kitchen (though a microwave and toaster oven).  But the room was good, the value was excellent, and Gregg was helpful.  Would stay here again."
9501054,952883794787928321,2023-08-07,380508737,Patrick,Gregg was a great host the place was very private and clean I felt comfortable and there was more then enough amenities there this was the 2nd air BNB I ever rented and it was the best one so far I will definitely stay there again for sure
9501054,956512522613230576,2023-08-12,162895451,Pamela,Gregg is a wonderful host. I always enjoy my stay.
9501054,966015573905932485,2023-08-25,263086463,Greg,Gregg was very easy to get in touch with and he quickly accommodated some requests I had - a real super host! :)
9501054,968188670418862245,2023-08-28,519044092,Reginald,"Felt Right At Home At Gregg’s. I Loved How He Let Me Be, I Felt Free, At Other Air BNBs I’ve Felt Micromanaged And It’s Frustrating. I Seen Gregg One Time We Had A Small Conversation And We Was On Our Way. He Offered Help Anytime I Needed, I Never Needed It But I Know He Would’ve Supplied It.He Had Everything Fully Stocked, The Space Is Huge. It’s Better In Person. I’ll Definitely Be Renting Again. The Place Is In Walking Distance Of The Greyhound And Central Ave. Where Everything Pretty Much Is."
9501054,973187291738447012,2023-09-04,81454408,Darlene,Convenient to the highway and to state offices. A great place for a overnight stop on a road trip.  Is exactly as advertised and Gregg is a great host
9501054,978966711283288234,2023-09-12,335915833,Brian,"Excellent location one block from Empire State Plaza. Old building, but well maintained and clean. Neighborhood felt transitional, but no significant safety concerns. Be sure to ask host about arrangements for a street parking pass and pay close attention to the parking signs, especially on Sunday and Monday night."
9501054,980518888995499933,2023-09-14,100516164,Pierre,Le logement de Gregg est très agréable. La chambre ressemble plus à un studio de part sa grandeur et son aménagement ! Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Gregg
9501054,983315123153640048,2023-09-18,489970016,Florian,"Kommunikation war gut. Unterkunft ist groß, hat ein eigenes Bad, Kühlschrank, alles da. Die Unterkunft ist auch fast ganz sauber. Allerdings ist sie Parterre, was sie sehr dunkel macht. Und das Foto zeigt das Hauseingang, nicht den Wohnungseingang. Das ist ungenau."
9501054,992117272194210954,2023-09-30,84992151,David,"If you are looking for a place that’s quiet, clean, has a comfortable bed and close to the convention hall, look no further. This Airbnb is marked in my book as the place to stay. We own 6 Airbnbs and know a good one when we see it."
9501054,1000014233060196279,2023-10-11,428020731,Barry,Gregg is the best! You'd be foolish to not stay at his place. Given it is right at the empire state plaza it is not noisy at all! And 250 ft from the friendliest bar/ restaurant in town. 6 stars!
9501054,1023296287500279814,2023-11-12,534014586,Rodrigo,Gregg is a super host. Everything was perfect

The room was clean, comfortable, and spacious. The fridge and microwave are great features as well. Gregg is responsive and he made sure I was enjoying my stay."
9501054,1038450528620877336,2023-12-03,538231413,David,Was in town for a couple nights to watch Siena and Albany basketball. Would stay there again.
9501054,1056646374843403216,2023-12-28,530387686,Harold,As before great place to stay any problems Gregg wa there to help very very comfortable peaceful just what I want will recommend Gregg to anyone thanks Gregg see you in About 6 weeks Harry

I’m already planning another stay within the next few months. I cannot recommend this place enough!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
9501054,1092887555533556470,2024-02-16,162895451,Pamela,It’s always a good stay at Gregg’s. He’s an excellent host and always available if anything comes up.

9501054,1102209620569372201,2024-02-29,323635882,José,"Good place to stay for a few nights. Room has ample space and most of what is necessary for eating (but not cooking) food and resting. Stayed for a few nights in winter and the room felt cold, so I had to keep a small electric heater running all the time, as the radiators did not work. There were some cobwebs behind the bed and some dust on the surface of furniture. It felt like sleeping in an antique shop, but overall a good experience, for a reasonable value. I did expect at some point to be able to wash my dish in the kitchen but it was not available, so at the owner's instructions, washed my dish in the bathroom sink which was a bit odd. Gregg was nice and generally, a good host."
9501054,1105916462764605733,2024-03-05,107793022,Jake,"Very nice spot in reasonable distance from Capitol area. Not the ritz, but perfectly suitable for an easy place to crash for a night or two. Gregg was great!"
9501054,1107350984687884182,2024-03-07,110525850,John,Gregg was very responsive to my request to check in an hour early and also to my request for restaurant recommendations. Helpful in every way.

9501054,1110987144660037274,2024-03-12,107793022,Jake,"Second time I stayed at Greggs and unfortunately this one was not as pleasant. There was an immediate cigarette smell walking inside that remained inside the room. That plus a very large, yellow stain on the bathroom rug made this a considerably less nice experience."
9501054,1112371627837039461,2024-03-14,5928256,Brian,Gregg was friendly and communicated well before and during the stay. The place was as described and suited my needs well.

INCREDIBLY comfortable bed and pillows, nice warm shower, amazing plush carpet.<br/>Cooking facilities including microwave, kettle, fridge and hotplate- didn't have a chance to use these but it was an impressive set up!<br/>Gregg was so helpful by text despite us arriving very late at night, and leaving early."
10768745,61539633,2016-02-05,22294427,John,Elizabeth is great and communicates well.  I was a last minute booking and it went off without a hitch.  Elizabeth was great and helpful and very knowledgable about the history of the area.  The neighborhood is fantastic.  Off street parking is nice too.
10768745,68891151,2016-04-07,12531358,Marilyn,"I am a graduate student at U. Albany and wanted to stay in a quiet room near the school for a month while I worked on comprehensive exams. The room that Liz had available was quiet, in a great location in a peaceful neighborhood, close to shops, restaurants, and the school. The off street parking pot was convenient. Liz was a great host - flexible, accommodating and thoughtful - she put a table in the room for me to use as a workspace.

10768745,74603559,2016-05-16,45239367,Yifan,Elizabeth is really nice and hospitable. She gave me a very warm welcome when I got there. Her place is in a park and the environment is very good. The room is very large and comfortable with a private bathroom. There is also a parking place. This is the place you want to spend the rest of life in.
10768745,76480805,2016-05-27,45555252,Pamela,"Beautiful and quiet neighborhood. Lovely setting in upscale location. The room was large and private bathroom a plus. I am 50, so my main complaint was the convertible sofa bed. Not very restful. If you are looking for quiet and a pool with shady deck space this summer, this place is for you! Awesome TV!"
10768745,82974956,2016-06-30,74503769,Thomas,Neighborhood was very quiet and private.  Enjoyed taking walks in the area in the evenings and there were a couple of places to shop or eat very nearby

There is also a private bathroom. Elizabeth is a very warm and kind person who made my stay less stressful and helped me a lot! She was so kind to pick me up from the bus station, drive me to the exam site and arranged for a place where I could leave my luggage and pick it up after the last exam. We could only wish for more hosts who are so kind!"
10768745,92543442,2016-08-09,82718797,Debra,"My stay at this location was everything I expected.  I appreciated the off street parking and quiet neighborhood.  The space was large and comfortable.  Bathroom facilities were great.  I've slept on many fold out couches in my time and was a bit concerned by a previous reviewer's experience.  I slept very comfortably.  Thank you, Liz!"
10768745,96139293,2016-08-21,87119914,Timothy,"Liz was a great host- easy to talk to and very conscientious about making my stay as comfortable as possible- not only at her place and but in Albany altogether. Liz was also very respectful of my privacy. 
<br/>The self -contained room had everything I needed for a nine-day stay, very pleasant, and the built-in pool in the back is an extra bonus. Would definitely recommend staying there."
10768745,97442438,2016-08-27,88220010,Alison,"While I wasn't able to meet her, Elizabeth was a wonderful host. The room was absolutely lovely, and was everything I expected. The pull out couch was very comfortable, and I slept very well on it. I also liked being able to keep food cold for the week, and a way to heat it up. The neighborhood was very nice, and I felt comfortable taking a long walk around after work. I'm glad I was able to stay in such a welcoming place!"
10768745,97525871,2016-08-27,22059112,Julia,"Very nice host, Liz gave us a very friendly and pleasant welcome. 
<br/>Good and quiet neighborhood.
<br/>"
10768745,97771502,2016-08-28,95755,Rosedel,"Elizabeth was great, courteous and helpful. The apartment was lovely, neat and true to the pictures. Would stay here again. "
10768745,102614041,2016-09-18,1740107,Dan,Checked in midday swam in the pool watched some college football. The Victorian decor was beautifully rhymed with heart of pine spotless floors. 
10768745,103100501,2016-09-20,95024412,Anisha,"Elizabeth is very friendly. She replied almost immediately. If you plan to stay here please make sure you know that there are no switches, there is a knob to turn the lights on. The studio is gorgeous, very nicely done, well maintained. I highly recommend staying here."
10768745,104443353,2016-09-26,95845410,Emaly,The room was great and very convenient.  Quite a steal for the price!
10768745,106681141,2016-10-07,22694319,Erica,"Liz left perfect instructions for how to get into her studio and was very accommodating of my ad lib arrival. Her place is exactly as pictured, and she was very attentive and accessible over text. I enjoyed the lovely neighborhood and felt safe and comfortable. "
10768745,107646228,2016-10-11,33617284,Valeria,Great location. The place was well equipped with everything needed for a pleasant stay. Communication was excellent. 
10768745,108111625,2016-10-14,36893068,Brian,"Beautiful studio apartment, thank you for the accommodation."
10768745,109881879,2016-10-23,82718797,Debra,"The accommodations are easily accessible.  I like to come and go as I please, and this location worked well.  The neighborhood is quiet and has sidewalks for anyone looking to take a walk.  Off street parking is a plus."
10768745,110978073,2016-10-29,42219433,Anne,"Usually when I imagine taking a trip by myself, I imagine having a luxurious room in which to relax--and then the reality is disappointing because I'm too cheap to get anything but the least expensive hotel room.
<br/>
<br/>This was the exception.  Elizabeth's studio is entirely charming and quite spacious.  The bed was soft and cozy, and the photos on Airbnb do not do justice to how adorable the place is.  It's in a quiet residential area of rather stately houses but walking distance to a CVS and Dunkin' Donuts and a 10-15 drive to downtown Albany.  I would definitely return if I was coming back to Albany."
10768745,113712012,2016-11-13,16286162,Pat,"I happened to stay at Elizabeth's studio while visiting my daughter at Albany college of Pharmacy. I loved the Victorian style decoration in the studio, clean comfortable, self-contained, quiet and tree lined neighborhood.  The neighborhood is close to Albany Medical Center, St. Peter's hospital, Sage College and Albany Law School. Elizabeth was thoughtful and responsive. Will stay again"
10768745,114197818,2016-11-16,103267221,Lauren,"Meeting Liz was the best part of my trip to Albany! She is a warm host who put so much loving kindness into my stay, even offering me a ride to work and showing me other parts of her home. The neighborhood felt very safe and Liz's house is a block from the bus line to Albany Medical Center and downtown Albany. "
10768745,116005121,2016-11-27,92894105,Lindsay,Great location.  Very quiet and private.  
10768745,116454157,2016-11-30,45775085,Dardan,Great place.
10768745,117070491,2016-12-04,9811770,Jon,I very much enjoyed my stay with Liz in Albany. The room was well appointed and very comfortable. The location is in a nice neighborhood close to local restaurants and bars with easy access to downtown and major thoroughfares. Liz is always quick to respond to a message and made sure that all was well with the stay. I would highly recommend checking out her place when visiting Albany!
10768745,120466245,2016-12-10,95660676,Shreedevi,"The space was lovely and well decorated. It was homey. However, I could not get any sleep! The bed is so uncomfortable and I kept waking up. "
10768745,121037738,2016-12-13,100582451,Elizabeth,Clean and easy for a quick trip 
10768745,121692943,2016-12-18,24397565,Nicole,"Liz's place was perfect. It's a spacious studio and beautifully decorated. There was a fridge, freezer, toaster, and electric kettle. The bed was comfy and the bathroom had a tub! There's parking near the front door and the entrance to the studio is directly after walking in, so it's private. I had a wonderful stay!"
10768745,122719438,2016-12-25,63961589,Jane,"Elizabeth was there to greet me and very welcoming. Her home was on a quiet street in town but close to restaurants, shopping and night life. The bed was so comfortable and the place was set up so nice. I will come again the next time that I am in Albany visiting grandchildren."
10768745,123764484,2016-12-30,4755802,Martin,Spacious historic suites with tall ceilings. Location is very walkable in an older neighborhood featuring a large public green. A quiet single family neighborhood. A short walk to nearby commercial uses and quick drive to main roadways. 
10768745,125027707,2017-01-03,95503584,Mirrah,Elizabeth was an exceptional host. She personally came to pick me up from the station and made sure the room I stayed in had everything I possibly needed. The room was beautifully decorated with a mini kitchen and an attached bathroom and had a lot of amenities. The place was very close to CVS and dunkin and Subway and other restaurants. I'd definitely stay with her again if I ever visit Albany again.
10768745,126402739,2017-01-11,110141728,Kathy,"You will not be disappointed.  Good value, safe, clean and ver comfortable.  Would definitely return."
10768745,126517349,2017-01-12,75637270,Amina,Great place and great deal. Close to everything. Are room was upgraded for no fee which was very kind. Would definitely return.

10768745,127722016,2017-01-20,14095028,Marta,"This was the second time I stayed at Liz's place, this time with my mum. Liz is a great host and a very nice person. She kindly picked us up and drove us to the coach station and made sure we had everything we needed. We got a bigger room, which is very well equipped. We loved the electric mattress! :)"
10768745,127850853,2017-01-21,63639265,Wayne,"Very cozy, quiet, clean place! If you're in the Albany area, Liz is a great host! Highly recommend "

10768745,128656629,2017-01-26,73110189,Anitha,"Liz is an extremely kind and gracious host.  She picked me up from the Amtrack station and showed me where my meeting was.  She had tea, coffee, milk and sweeter in the room.  She had cable and a heated bed.  She really thought of everything a guest Could possibly need.  Her place was exactly as described.  Very unique and charming place that felt clean and safe.  Thank you Liz "
10768745,131249887,2017-02-11,81458056,Kendall,Wonderful accommodations. <br/>
10768745,132361136,2017-02-17,94540399,Tatiana,"This little apartment is a home away from home. It's quiet, private, and restful. Liz's attention to detail shows, from the well-stocked bathroom to the fact that there is a tea-maker in addition to a coffee machine. Liz communicated well throughout, and check-in was smooth. "
10768745,133428643,2017-02-22,7788626,Adi,"Liz's house was wonderful. It was quiet, cozy and warm, and I had a great time there. "
10768745,135302329,2017-03-04,69543072,Regina,"Liz was the ultimate host. The unit was extremely comfortable and conveniently located. I arrived at 1am and the bed was already warm for me!!!! Liz activated the heated blanket prior to my arrival.  It is extremely cold here...18 degrees when I arrived so that was truly thoughtful of her. Nice sized, cable TV that literally watched me was also available. LOL....I was exhausted. I'll always stay here if I'm near Albany!😍😍😍😍😍"
10768745,136423216,2017-03-10,118075443,Winfred,"Everything was just like Elizabeth described it as being,"
10768745,136563971,2017-03-11,42586756,Ashley,"This space is awesome! I'm a bit of an anglophile so just the ambiance and decoration of the flat was enough to win me over. The bed was comfortable and though there's not a kitchen, there's a mini-fridge and microwave - all the essentials you need. It was private and had off street parking which for Albany, is a luxury! I hope to stay here again and would highly recommend you do as well!"
10768745,150377421,2017-05-07,61967603,Giovanny,Elizabeth was very nice and helpful her house is very cozy and has everything you need she supplies it. Will definitely recommend staying here
10768745,150690875,2017-05-08,15657683,Sam,"Excellent place to stay.  Beautiful room and neighborhood.  Easy check-in/out. Very nice amenities coffee, toaster, soap etc."
10768745,153081018,2017-05-19,112770548,P,"This is a very lovely suite in a Victorian home. Private. Very pretty area, park like setting, close to everything. Walkable to stores. Hostess has every detail covered, literally bring your toothbrush. The bed was super comfy. Huge t.v., cable, WiFi. Easy access. Definitely recommend. 💓🖒"
10768745,153725558,2017-05-21,14314245,David,Cozy and comfortable small apartment in a great neighborhood!
10768745,154463816,2017-05-24,7808239,Enid,"Elizabeth has done a great job of creating a private apartment feeling in her home.  The home is on a small park on a really quiet street, and I opened the windows at night to a quiet evening.  Elizabeth was great to communicate with and left nice treats in the apartment - bagels in the fridge, milk, etc..<br/>The only thing I would note is that the bed is a pull-out couch with a mattress topper - it is pretty comfortable for a pull out couch, but it is not a bed per se.  So if you need a firm mattress, it would not be the best fit."
10768745,157750712,2017-06-04,39423359,Will,"I was so pleased with Liz's place. It was very comfortable, homey, and it corresponded exactly with the description. Albany turned out to be a lovely place to visit. I'll want to stay at this Airbnb the next time I come to Albany in a year. "
10768745,160069531,2017-06-12,23500984,Ashley,Would easily stay here again with no hesitation!
10768745,163762808,2017-06-25,5065637,Ilga,"Lovely host, spacious room, and great location, including a very nice leafy park across the street. "
10768745,165675671,2017-07-01,1816078,Suzanne,Quaint and spacious and a great location. Would stay again!<br/>Spacious
10768745,166740729,2017-07-04,2722216,Wes,"This was my second stay at Elizabeth's place, and I was happy to find almost all of the unit in the same condition it had been earlier.  But there was no air conditioning, as of early July 2017.<br/>"
10768745,168505789,2017-07-09,138266758,Brian,"Beautiful place, great value"
10768745,169771004,2017-07-13,109345250,Mardy, Lovely 
10768745,172038509,2017-07-19,138398806,Akshit,Liz was a very good host :) We had a wonderful stay. Look forward to staying there again if I ever come to this place next time .
10768745,173092780,2017-07-22,135894667,Omar,"The description of this room does not do its character and coziness any justice. Such an accommodating and kind host, at a beautiful home at an awesome location. You're central to anywhere you want to go in Albany or the surrounding capital district. Would recommend to any and everyone, unless they're considering visiting the same time I am! (I'd want it for myself again lol)"
10768745,173615719,2017-07-23,107265523,Ian,"If you get a chance to book this room, snap it up! Exquisitely appointed, and lovely.  The bed is a fold out and very soft, so not for people who need a hard sleeping surface.  Elizabeth is a delightful, thoughtful and engaging hostess.  I wish I had more time to chat with her!"
10768745,174983126,2017-07-27,14292383,William,"Great location, huge room, and best price. "
10768745,175725170,2017-07-29,78833127,Annie,"The studio had a lot of character, typical old school Albany feel. Had a very pleasant stay."
10768745,178519493,2017-08-05,125905409,Morgan,"The studio was perfect for my stay in Albany. It was both extremely comfortable and beautifully decorated. Liz had all the basics covered, making it much easier to pack for my trip. The location was great, both off of the main drag enough to be peaceful and still close enough to be convenient. I definitely hope to stay again in the future!"
10768745,180941610,2017-08-11,9152445,Marshall,The room is filled with British Isles old world charm that reminded me of my stays in Wales as a child.  Liz is a fantastic host and a kind person. She was very understanding about a last minute change in my work schedule and took it upon herself to assist me in finding an apartment - I'm new to the Albany area. Recommend highly.
10768745,181360518,2017-08-12,2203986,Amy,"Perfect, comfortable, clean, and very quiet. I stopped to sleep while driving from montreal to NYC - and Elizabeth's was a much nicer experience than staying in a motel. The check in /out process was easy, the room large, and while I didn't meet Elizabeth in person, she was easy to communicate with and everything was ready for me. Strongly recommend."
10768745,181893158,2017-08-13,23211505,Erin,"Elizabeth's place was great - private and quiet. Liz was easy to communicate with, and answered questions promptly. A great value for the price!"
10768745,182860074,2017-08-15,30868100,Matteo,"Liz was a very helpful host. The studio apartment was well equipped with minifridge, air conditioning etc. I had a great stay and would definitely recommend staying with Elizabeth!"
10768745,187202001,2017-08-26,147500345,Ajani,Elizabeth was an amazing host <br/>Her place is even more beautiful in person and my stay there was amazing.<br/>Look forward to coming back.
10768745,187733013,2017-08-27,145236096,Peter,Very convenient location and clean space. Liz is very responsive :)
10768745,188814363,2017-08-30,147723198,Phyllis,"I felt right at home.  This, I believe, is the best compliment one can give when they are away from home.  There wasn't one thing I needed that was not included in my accommodation.  In addition, Elizabeth provided coffee, tea, biscuits, soaps (of all kinds), blow dryer, iron.  She supplied it all.  Elizabeth is warm, pleasant and very welcoming.  I highly recommend her accommodations.  I liked staying at Elizabeth's so much I have re-booked for a longer stay next week."
10768745,190198312,2017-09-03,110806938,Edi,"Cozy and cute place to stay.  Easy check in and out.  Elizabeth was quick to accept and respond to my reservation which was short notice.  Even though the bed is a pull out couch, it was very comfortable.  Everything I needed was available."
10768745,190938208,2017-09-05,139724702,Rachel,"Adorable place! I had a nice time staying there. Studio was the perfect size for me and had everything that I needed. Liz was also very nice, and quickly responded to messages"
10768745,191744096,2017-09-08,147723198,Phyllis,"Elizabeth's accommodation are clean, comfortable, bright and welcoming.<br/>This is the second time I have stayed with her, and just like my first visit,<br/>I felt right at home.<br/>I highly recommend Elizabeth and her accommodations."
10768745,192503392,2017-09-10,64191915,Fraz,This place was extremely comfortable even though the bed is a pull out couch it feels just like a bed and is paired with an extremely comfortable blanket and more pillows that you will know what to do with. Depending on body sizes it might be too small for two people. All the creature comforts are available in the room including a large TV. The decor made me feel right at home and super relaxed. I would definitely recommend this place for someone that needs a place to stay.
10768745,192905362,2017-09-11,84004239,Valerie,"Lots of character in this cozy safe large studio. Lots of extras, micro wave, fridge and plenty of toiliteries. Off street parking and plenty of privacy at Elizabeth's place."
10768745,193449691,2017-09-13,53350519,Tim,The apartment was as described. Elizabeth was extremely responsive.
10768745,194040972,2017-09-15,26023661,Juan Pablo,"Her place was super clean, cozy, and convenient! Thank you!"
10768745,194310879,2017-09-16,6927487,Emilia,"This is an ideal Airbnb experience. Liz is a wonderful host, she made the check in smooth, easy and convenient. The location was beautiful, the room was perfectly equipped with a mini-fridge, AC, coffee maker and a clean bathroom. Liz even went above and beyond to make my stay easy, by driving me to my exam in the morning. I wish all Airbnb's were this well organized! Highly, highly recommend."
10768745,195258397,2017-09-18,101081033,Joan,"The location of this room is excellent, the neighborhood lovely but this room is not as represented. Half of the house appears to be owner occupied and the other half a boarding house. The room I rented looked like someone was living there and moved out so a guest could check in. <br/>There were open bottles of juice and milk in the mini fridge, new but food items left,  many leftover toiletries in the bath including used bars of soap, a dish full of change on the top of a radiator. The closet was 3/4 full of old linens, pillows, junk, the floor wasn't even clear for my suitcase. Coffee pot was not clean. The room was filled with extension cords one being plugged into the next, this is a safety hazard, one was taped to the floor. <br/>The owner entered my room and unplugged the A/C when I ran out to buy a cup of coffee and told me I did not pay enough to keep A/C running or lights on if I were not in the room. <br/>There was no exterior lighting or hallway lighting so the only way to even get to the house or unlock exterior and interior door was with the flashlight on my phone.<br/>I wish I could post pictures that would actually show what this property looked like."
10768745,197143671,2017-09-24,107265523,Ian,Still a gem!  Wish I could book this place every time.
10768745,197446363,2017-09-25,148417789,Oluwasegun,Really nice host and easy to communicate with.
10768745,199228550,2017-10-01,91022285,Cielo,"I really enjoyed staying at Elizabeth's place in Albany . It's a beautiful home and I like the vintage vibes about it . If you have an appreciation for older homes , you will love staying here . The room also had lovely decor . Pretty spacious and private bathroom . She also provides a mini fridge , hair dryer , shampoo , tea , coffee , milk , water etc . And nice flat screen tv to watch some shows on when you get back after a long day. I recommend this place to anyone who is staying in Albany , it's so close to downtown ! Go see and walk around  Washington Park - my favorite part about my day in Albany ."
10768745,201065766,2017-10-07,153118816,Kathleen,"Fantastic place. Comfy, safe, relaxing. Liz is a fantastic host. Super friendly and attentive. Great garden and lots of outdoor seating. This is a must stay place. You won't be disappointed. Thanks a bunch Liz for your hospitality and kindness."
10768745,202299734,2017-10-10,6279229,Lauree,"Lovely, cozy studio apartment attached to larger home. Easy communication and check-in and I felt comfortable and at home. Very quiet in the evening and a lovely neighborhood. I would recommend staying here and will consider staying again if I visit Albany in the future! Elizabeth goes above and beyond to make certain your stay is comfortable!"
10768745,203243602,2017-10-14,89446360,Tracy,I felt like a princess. It was like waking into an English Garden. I almost expected Bilbo Baggins to on my door for tea
10768745,203667239,2017-10-15,145236096,Peter,I stayed at Liz's place again and was not disappointed. Worth every penny!
10768745,204517095,2017-10-18,76310938,Magdala,Nice place to rest up and very private. Would return again

10768745,206460339,2017-10-25,118884450,Dan,"Lots of character and nice prints in this cute studio space! Quiet neighborhood but walking distance from some quick, convenient eats."
10768745,207172179,2017-10-28,26762085,Amy,"After a trip to NYC for business, I took the train from the city to Albany and did not arrive to Elizabeth's until 10:15 PM. Elizabeth's directions on parking, accessing the property, and description of the room in her listing were excellent. I was only there for 8 hours, enough time to shower, and get a good night of sleep before making the 3.5 hour drive home the next morning. The location is close to the Albany hospitals, and to local highways making it an ideal location for such a short visit."

10768745,332116572,2018-10-04,55244603,Jennifer,"I was disappointed in the stay. When I arrived, I was immediately struck by a strong smell in the hallway leading to my room (some sort of liquid potpourri). The bathroom was clean and nice and the location was good but everything else was not what I expected at all. The bed was a sofa pull out with a thin mattress. There were small moths, like pantry moths, in the room that were flying at me and I had to kill several of them. The bed/sofa was dusty and appeared to have animal hairs on it. The refrigerator made a loud noise on and off throughout the night. The walls and floors were very thin and I heard people moving around upstairs, coughing, etc. from the time I got there throughout the night and into the morning. I did not sleep at all and did not go back for the second night. For these reasons, I cannot recommend staying here."

10768745,419276241,2019-03-03,238754182,John,Cozy room with a private bathroom. Pull out sofa to sleep on. Perfect stay for 1 or 2 people.
10768745,419704736,2019-03-04,68848300,Simon,"The studio was very nicely decorated by Liz, and it's filled with thoughtful amenities such as a water boiler and assortment of tea bags. The neighbors above were a little bit loud before 6 pm but everyone was respectful of the quiet hours posted. Overall I'm very happy with my stay and I would come back if I'm in Albany again."
10768745,420761292,2019-03-07,227626649,Pat,Very fun place to stay. The room is comfortable and very private.

10768745,432661479,2019-04-04,214873361,Deborah,a wonderful experience as usual <br/>thank you for a comfortable and beautiful place to rest
10768745,434218732,2019-04-07,249589000,Michael,Liz is a great host. The pictures do not do justice to the coziness of the place. Liz provided information on local food and other stores. She really makes you feel welcomed and comfortable. I would definitely stay again if I am in the area.
10768745,434833509,2019-04-08,71534772,Stephanie,"Cozy place, nice for a quick stay. The bed is a pull out couch but actually wasn’t that bad. Nice little touches around the studio. The only thing that was bothersome were the moths flying around as well as the paper thin walls, you could hear the other people very clearly but they did stop around 10-11 Pm."
10768745,435125297,2019-04-09,58199454,Justin,Better value than a hotel!
10768745,435467738,2019-04-10,172112801,Bill,"Quite and comfortable, old style, you will like it."
10768745,446947357,2019-05-02,175335571,Mark,Another great stay
10768745,448023876,2019-05-04,2050268,Christine,"The place is amazing ,,, big windows, old wood, great bathroom,,, very Victorian,,,,and comfy bed despite the fact that its a pull out ,,, <br/>Great place to stay especially for the price"
10768745,448656244,2019-05-05,234628994,Samuel,I only met this host in passing. She was really nice and smart. I believe she's exactly what people want to encounter when they do Air B&B. I'd definitely stay with her again.
10768745,450197645,2019-05-08,60559031,Meredith,"I have stayed at Liz's place several times now. She has always been so accommodating and welcoming! She responds quickly, and is always so wonderful to interact with! Her place is a very comfortable and safe studio apartment, with clean linens and towels. Check-in and check-out are super simple! And off street parking is very convenient. I would highly recommend and I would most definitely stay there again! Thank you Liz for providing my home away from home!"
10768745,450540853,2019-05-09,242778888,Sifan,A cozy and sweet home！
10768745,450864245,2019-05-10,135711652,Joyce,"This was a quick crash pad for me on a longer trip. Elizabeth's place was in a great neighborhood, check-in was easy, and the space was comfortable and convenient. The house seems to be broken up into several units, so there was some coming and going in the hall outside my room, but it didn't bother me. I don't know if the noise went late or not because I sleep with a white-noise machine at all times. All in all, this is a comfortable and convenient spot."
10768745,454514966,2019-05-18,249662743,Lori,This was more than I expected.  Would definitely contact Elizabeth again if I come to town.
10768745,457638692,2019-05-24,10123524,Nicholas,This location is awesome.  Very funky and Upstate-ly.  Comfortable bed and plenty of fascinating decorations.  A great night stay in Albany awaits....

10768745,469388144,2019-06-14,53059328,Katie,"Great space for our night in Albany, nice quiet neighbourhood"
10768745,472375333,2019-06-19,13596338,Neal,"Liz's place is a sweet very affordable quiet room with a private bath.  The neighborhood is quiet and green and Liz was a responsive host.  It is in a lovely old home stylistic character and charm.  <br/>It was  listed as having a kitchen which does not feel accurate to me. There is a fridge, a microwave, a electric kettle to boil water but no option for pan boiling or sauteing and very minimal utensils (ex. no cutting board or cooking knives, dining plates).  It also has no sink separate for the bathroom hand washing sink which would be insufficient for washing up after cooking a real meal.  The place seems set up for heating up already prepared food but not for preparing food from ingredients."
10768745,474927298,2019-06-23,65719067,Janos,"Very nice quaint room in a lovely old home in a beautiful, quiet, neighborhood.  Great communication.  Highly recommend."

10768745,476571249,2019-06-26,1191441,Justin,"Elizabeth's place offers peace and tranquility across from a calm green park, and just a short drive to restaurants and AMC. The room has everything you need, and it's quite comfortable."
10768745,479109856,2019-06-30,131848996,Jacob,"The room has a warm, quiet atmosphere, perfect for decompressing from your travels or recharging for more. For those who prefer soft lighting, the room is well suited for late night pontificating or relaxed reading."
10768745,483480328,2019-07-07,207840614,Sam,"Safe, quiet, and comfortable place to stay"
10768745,491763159,2019-07-20,200797153,Brandon,Nice and quaint place. We saw a concert at the Times Union Center and it was only 15 minutes away. Would definitely recommend!
10768745,492770669,2019-07-21,88492682,Mike,"Charming, quiet space in an upscale Albany neighborhood. Liz has added so many personal touches it feels like home. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying over in Albany looking for a tranquil out of the way spot yet in the city itself. I look forward to staying there on my next trip to Albany"

10768745,499476453,2019-07-31,148905667,Basheer & Ghadeer,The house was clean and the owner Mrs. Elizabeth was very helpful and provided us with all support that we need to make my wife’s staying comfortable.<br/>Overall experience was really good and we do recommend Mrs. Elizabeth’s studio.
10768745,501444529,2019-08-03,213812953,Jessie,Very comfortable and clean.

10768745,524817273,2019-09-06,284253414,Jane,This was my second stay at Liz's and it was wonderful. Everything was clean and her place is warm and comfy.

10768745,538288949,2019-09-29,176932440,Nikki,"Communication with Liz is easy and everything was ready and available as expected and described. The clawfoot tub and chandelier were unexpected and wonderful touches.  The entire decor is lovely and welcoming.  The house is very quiet and the neighborhood is just enough removed from the busy streets that you can get a good, full night's rest.  I was only there one night for my college reunion, but I shall definitely look to stay here again when I am back in town.  The room has a hairdryer, kettle and coffeemaker, microwave and small fridge, ample lighting and seating and a large table that could double as a workspace desk if needed."
10768745,539964817,2019-10-02,108048555,Nigel,The space was just perfect. Very stylish and close to everything.
10768745,542478690,2019-10-06,123034391,Katlynn,"Liz’s place worked well for a quick post-conference stay. The house is older but has all of the essentials. There are others living within the building but the room/bathroom is private. The WiFi worked great, the room was clean when I arrived. The neighborhood is quiet and I felt safe. Overall a nice value and my stay went smoothly!"

10768745,545569311,2019-10-12,98941732,Leo,"Very cute, cozy little place in a quiet neighborhood very close to downtown. Tons of charm. <br/>One thing I will say is that the place is old, so the doors make a decent amount of noise. Be careful if you’re checking in sometime during the evening/night."
10768745,547600026,2019-10-15,139698937,Jessica,"I loved staying at Liz’s place. The whole studio was very comfortable, stylish, and there was plenty of space. No complaints at all. Definitely recommend!"

I highly recommend staying here!!"

10768745,570426519,2019-11-29,261001385,Sharon,Elizabeth place has charm and character. And the area is quite. A great recipe for a romantic stay. Although it’s more of a privet room with a privet bath then a studio apartment and the amenities are limited we were pretty comfortable.

10768745,574789454,2019-12-08,61407802,Jesse,"A really comfortable bed! A really spacious table to work on. Old upstate NY charm. A pleasant couch for reading. A responsive host. Keurig coffee, an electric pot for hot water, some combination of green, black, and herbal tea selections, a mug, fridge (with miscellaneously useful things, including (my experience/use) English muffins and milk). Price point is accurate and I had a great stay!!"
10768745,575848454,2019-12-11,237228738,Louise,I keep coming back to stay because it has such a welcoming and homey feel!

10768745,593351245,2020-01-15,5295358,Titcha,"This was my second stay at Elizabeth's place. The reason I went back was that this place was in a quiet neighborhood, but it was close enough to the University of Albany. This place will be my top choice if I have to stay in Albany again in the future."

10768745,616545725,2020-03-09,297577134,Konyia,No kitchen. There’s a door in the apartment leading to her apartment which is creepy! Felt uneasy staying there.. Good for a short stay if you don’t need to cook & don’t want privacy. Also I canceled the reservation and checked out early and she didn’t want to refund me my money for all the days I wasn’t staying there. Wouldn’t recommend.
10768745,618762560,2020-03-15,341189838,MaChris,Liz gave clear instructions. Located in a nice quiet neighborhood. The room was so cozy and homey. Both the bed and couch were extremely comfortable. Perfect place to stay for a weekend. If I ever need a place to stay in Albany I wouldn't hesitate to come back here.

The unit itself (a converted living room) is beautifully decorated (the photos don’t do it justice) and extremely comfortable for a solo traveler or a couple looking to explore the region. The area feels a bit suburban, but is a short drive to some cute restaurants, and not far at all from downtown. And the price point can’t be beat! Highly highly recommend."

I was only in town overnight but this would be a good place to stay for a few days, it is spacious and comfortable. Elizabeth was very communicative and accommodated me on short notice. I really appreciated that the bedding does not have a strong detergent smell... This would be a good place if you are sensitive to fragrance/chemicals. There is a WiFi router next to the bed that appears to be for the other units as well as this one. I moved it away from the bed while sleeping. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a restful stay in Albany!"
10768745,663900031,2020-09-13,85017467,Daniel,This is an AirBnb to beat all AirBnbs! Charming comfortable interiors and wonderful and fun exteriors. Very convenient to highways in a classic suburban neighborhood setting. Elizabeth couldn't be nicer!

10768745,739874726,2021-03-17,175881807,Kerry,"It's really tastefully decorated and, for the price, you just can't beat it!  It's centrally located if you want to be in the capital district of New York.  It's quiet and quaint, yet classy and chic!  It felt spacious for a studio apartment, and I was very safe and comfortable in Albany, an city that does have some not-so-safe-and-comfortable areas.  All in all, it was a pleasure.  I definitely recommend!!"
10768745,740033622,2021-03-18,157441383,Marcello,great place to stay!

10768745,752370212,2021-04-26,117612113,Stephanie,"The house is listed as “entire house to yourself” when in fact you share the house with other guests. You do have the studio space to yourself, but there are others in the house with you. The host did not clarify that she would be on the property. Her room/apartment is on the other side of the studio space which made me uncomfortable. Although she specified no animals, she herself owns a dog. Such information should be articulated in the listing."
10768745,752643243,2021-04-27,31517410,Bear,Great stay and great location!
10768745,753070433,2021-04-29,175335571,Mark,Nice quiet location with off-street parking.  Unit is spacious and comfortable.
10768745,754097851,2021-05-02,133792790,Annie,Liz was an outstanding host.  The house and property were out of the 1800s mixed with the quirkiness of an artist.  Birds and nature surround the home with an outdoor bohemian-like retreat.  The room itself had the comfort of home with the majestic design of the Victorian-era.  I loved this experience.
10768745,754675684,2021-05-03,125265670,Sandy,Wonderful charming place 😊

10768745,757039065,2021-05-10,37017190,Elaine,"Liz was great as a hostess! She communicates quickly, efficiently and in fact, was even there to meet me on my first day checking in. Her apt has its own private bathroom with shower and a little sofa area along with a table and work area. There is a kitchenette with little fridge and microwave as well as electric kettle. Liz had kindly left some spreads, bread and milk for me!! Her apt is easy to access and the bed is comfortable. There is parking on the driveway and street. Although across from hospital, not noisy at all and quite a cute neighborhood!! Location is within walking distance to a CVS and cafe little further down the street, if needed!"
10768745,757796428,2021-05-13,157394076,Natalie,"Lovely antique home in a nice neighborhood. The studio is about the size of a hotel suite, quite comfortable and very cute.

The apartment has heat and air conditioning. There is a bathtub with shower. Good wifi. I have had zoom meetings there without issues. Kitchenette with many essentials including microwave and mini fridge. Would recommend!!"
10768745,763361515,2021-05-28,73412995,Shawn,Cool space for the lonely work traveler or adventuring couple. Definitely take advantage of the provided bath salts and draw up a nice hot bath in the old school peg leg bathtub.

10768745,447794099436634352,2021-09-09,2660721,Meredith,"Great place! I had a very short stay -- checked in quite late (rather bedraggled, after a rather long, rainy walk) and checked out very early the next morning, but had a wonderfully comfortable stay in between. The suite is spacious and well-fitted-out ... and I especially appreciated the little touches like snacks (I was also quite hungry by the time I arrived, and loath to go back out in the rain!), tea/coffee, etc. Communications and access were all clear and simple. The unit is within the larger house, but completely private. Will happily stay again!"

Only small issue was that it was a bit hard to find became the house’s numbers aren’t visible at night. But Elizabeth responded immediately to my phonecalls for help. Great host, great stay. Will be back again!"

It’s a lovely space in a convenient central location with some nice welcoming touches (such as a little coffee and tea bar). I enthusiastically recommend Elizabeth’s place to fellow travellers to Albany.

10768745,890609922541298688,2023-05-13,6826820,Amanda,"I have stayed here twice now, it's a great spot. This little studio apartment is in an old Victorian and has lots of charm. It is helpful to have a mini-fridge, microwave, and kettle available for use. The room is not particularly sound-proof so folks sensitive to noise may be occasionally disturbed by noise from the adjacent apartments."
10768745,891318488699667626,2023-05-14,270595224,Laura,"I had a very pleasant stay w Elizabeth. Beautiful, quiet neighborhood & a very cozy room (fabulous bed). I loved the decor.

It was a nice studio with a comfy bed, kitchenette, table, private bathroom, and window nook. I felt right at home. Easy check-in via lockbox next to the front door. The porch is also beautiful!"

10768745,911589735826406206,2023-06-11,14658486,Joshua,"Great place for the price, but there is a strong smell of dogs and a lot of dog fur/dander in the apartment. While not allergic, I was very itchy and needed to shower pretty quickly after entering. Still, the space was as advertised, had private parking, was clean, and pretty quiet. Great for the value if you are okay with dog hair/small."
10768745,917362169225157177,2023-06-19,495019373,Josh,"This place was great: clean, quiet, comfortable, and private. I loved the historic home and the tasteful eclectic decor. I wish I could have stayed longer."

10768745,942758793260931917,2023-07-24,521439967,Latanya,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was exactly what I expected . It was quiet and peaceful.

10768745,950759950974751422,2023-08-04,30352107,Lisa,"This would be a lot more worth it if you brought 4 or 5 people for a full 12 hours.  Like, you could split it four ways and all sleep comfortably; I was just intrigued by a positive review of icy AC.<br/>As one person, who wasn’t there longer than 5 hours, this was such a blessing and oasis.  It felt like a luxurious splurge.  Really clear directions how to get in.  Thank you!"
10768745,952220087304500749,2023-08-06,507297799,Rokesh,"Great place, great location."

The garden area is so peaceful and serene. I wish I could have stayed longer! I will definitely be back."

10768745,971092189281121875,2023-09-01,33192262,Emily,"Cute, quaint, and quiet. Wallpaper and paintings and clutter (including collection of unwatchable VCRs - sadly no books!) give it a feel of staying at a grandparent's house. The place was very easy to find, right off the highway, and the location was lovely and calm for a brief overnight stay. Would have appreciated a porch light when arriving at night, but the directions were clear and easy to follow. The nearby neighborhood seem to be charming."

10768745,990625769477813955,2023-09-28,536173674,Kemaray,"I hate to be the one to leave a bad review, but I arrived to the place at night first and foremost once there I put the key code in to get the key and the key wasn’t there! I call and texted the host several times to no avail, I sat outside for 45 mins contacting Airbnb support who also couldn’t get in touch with the host! I end up sitting outside for 1.5 hours before someone finally came! This when it gets worst the person who responds wasn’t even the and had to go find a key to open the studio ! Worst experience of my life!"
10768745,994249926338088994,2023-10-03,26757901,Colleen,"Great spot for my overnight work trip. Nice and unique space that was comfortable, private, and easy access"

10768745,1001505100502782820,2023-10-13,12529537,Lawrence,See my review from 10/13-14 stay.Booked the room for a second night.Nothing else need be said.
10768745,1002164100886539004,2023-10-14,12529537,Lawrence,"I just completed my 2nd stay with Elizabeth,and have now resided in both the red and blue room.Well appointed,gazebo and pool closed for the season (but I was able to stroll around it for the first time)curtains were drawn to black out the room and hold back the night chill common for this time of year.<br/>She had some new menus that I didn't know about or tried (started University here in '75),which came in very handy after a long day's journey into night for each of the 2 I stayed.Great to sit outside on her porch during warm afternoons, curl up with a book either there or the couch near the windows and curtains which overlook it.<br/>Surrounding counties and their respective charms are ready for perusal, and occup a large round table I found very useful for my working vacation."
10768745,1007288666148664682,2023-10-21,82430190,Katy,"The studio was spacious and well-equipped. The vintage style is kind of fun but rather busy, and the space gets very little daylight so it can feel rather oppressive. The area is a pleasant, residential part of the city so felt nice and safe but (and this is my fault for not doing my research properly) not terribly convenient for travellers without their own transport. The nearest supermarket is about 25 minutes' walk away and there are very few cafes or shops close by. There are regular buses into the city centre, though, so for a short stay that wouldn't be such a problem. The host didn't really respond to messages which caused me some difficulties in planning my travel arrangements."
10768745,1007965034601435062,2023-10-22,511862175,Patrick,Very comfortable and quiet arrangement. Highly recommend.

10768745,1036248586733166446,2023-11-30,118194726,Cheryl,"This air bnb studio apartment was one of the best places I have stayed in for the money.  The studio apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood, but yet close to restaurants, the Palace Theater, and the MVP Arena.  I was able to make coffee in the morning, as well as eat  a small breakfast. (much appreciated Liz; you have thought of everything). I would stay here again in the future. I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when in the Albany area."

10768745,1052934820155745133,2023-12-23,103058678,Ankit,"The studio section of the house was equipped with refrigerator, microwave and napkins were thoughtfully kept there<br/>The restroom was pretty clean.<br/>The lights were a little dim for the room but that is a no issue<br/>Old house but well kept.<br/>Elizabeth was kind enough to allow me late checkin. I stayed for 2 nights and would recommend this anytime"

10768745,1063740318070867419,2024-01-07,402543391,Mike,"Elizabeth was an unkind person, after providing very poor and ambiguous instructions to check in. Steer clear of her mental illness, for your own sake."
10768745,1064619108880885190,2024-01-08,84705773,Cassidy,"This is my third stay at Elizabeth’s. No complaints, she’s wonderful and her place is just what I need during my weekends on call."

10768745,1079795494506137351,2024-01-29,408032111,Jay,Thank you Elizabeth. Definitely a place I would go back if I am in the area.
10768745,1082686598092447139,2024-02-02,8678225,Carolyn,"The ""studio"" I stayed in was exactly as pictured and described. It was a spacious room with its own full bathroom, which included useful amenities for those who forgot their own (i.e., toothpaste, shampoo, etc.), a table and chairs, sofa and a tiny ""kitchenette"" of a microwave, mini fridge, toaster oven and hot pot, as well as a basket of snacks and oatmeal. Paper plates, cups and utensils were also provided. The place overall was quiet and private and had light-blocking drapes so it was easy to sleep in. Guests should be aware that there is another guest ""studio"" across the hall, and they share an entrance but nothing else; Liz also has an apartment adjoining the room, but I hardly heard anything from her side of the door we shared. Also, the house is old and is heated by old-fashioned hot water heaters that, while quieter than the clanging hot water heaters I grew up with, do make occasional noise (the first time I heard it, I thought there was a mouse in my room!)."
10768745,1084853044093948226,2024-02-05,395637068,Kayla,Great little place in Albany. Definitely would recommend to others. A few walkable restaurants and many other things within a short drive. Host was great. Place was clean.
10768745,1093545354024307592,2024-02-17,142042698,Kristy,"Great place to stay - perfect place to crash the night before an early morning flight. Easy to find, very friendly and responsive host, and everything I needed all in one place. Super comfy bed, lots of character, and easy process all around. Great little place to stay if you’re passing through Albany - would stay again :)"

It’s a little cold there’s a note about not turning up the heat too high because of the connected radiators but there were blankets around. The bed was so warm, cozy and comfortable: great thick bedding, I slept wonderfully. Tv and nice late check out time. It’s a quiet neighbourhood, easy to find and park. There was tea, coffee, oatmeal and breakfast bars which was a nice extra touch. Close drive to lots of places nearby. I would stay again if in the area. Thanks Elizabeth!"

My goal while there was to focus on a book on writing and it was a perfect spot for it - quiet and peaceful. I’ll be back next time I need some uninterrupted time to write!"
10768745,1127659981397923775,2024-04-04,9118323,Judith,Very responsive and kind host.  Tempurpedic mattress.  Scented detergent. Funky and fun decoration.  Deep tub tho very short (3 feet maybe?).  Excellent price point.  Great space for a short stay.  Would def stay there again.

The communication was super easy and quick & the place looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and quiet! Would absolutely recommend staying there! If you get the opportunity to speak with Elizabeth, all the luckier for you as the lilting Irish accent is awesome to listen to!"

A bed, “mini” kitchen ( that has a mini /fridge freezer combo, microwave, toaster oven, drip coffee pot, tea pot,  Keurig,  utensils, there is coffee/ tea/ sugar. ) this is so thought out and kind. The private room and bathroom is very roomy with so much charm. The history of this charming home is such a pleasure to experience. I have many future plans to stay here.

Elizabeth was so kind and responsive, and while the studio looked great from the listing, it was even better in person. So much care was taken with every detail. The backyard and garden especially tickled me; I can't imagine a lovelier place to while away a summer evening. I hope I can make it back to Albany just to be able to stay here again."

A lot bigger than I thought, was pleasantly surprised to find out it was like a little studio apartment - instead of a room in her house. So all the furniture I saw in the pictures was in my room - that was great. Wish I got to spend more time there, but it was well worth the money. Thank you so much!"
10768745,1192087331614378811,2024-07-02,92317601,Ann,It was a lively room with all the amenities you could want. The bed was VERY comfortable. I wished I was staying more than one night. There is a lovely garden that I didn’t have time to enjoy.

10768745,1195007770116735023,2024-07-06,13783392,Jenn,"What an amazing hidden gem this place is!! The house is set back a bit in the trees and when I pulled my Mini in and saw Elizabeth's Mini, I knew we were off to a good start. Once inside the Red Room, I was greeted by the sweetest studio, with some notes from Elizabeth-- the most surprising was an invitation to her patio/garden area, grill, and in-ground pool!! I don't remember reading this in the registration page, so for future guests, bring your bathing suits!! The room was cozy and the bathroom had a beautiful clawfoot tub- complete with Epsom salts. The bed was SUPER comfy. The sun came out the next day and I took a tour of the back terrace, plants, pool, lawn. Beautiful. Did some yoga, poolside, soaked in the tub, and headed out by the noon check out. This place is perfect for concert goers (like me) needing a bit of R&R before heading back to real life. I'd love to be back!!"

Had to remind myself to lock the door because it felt like staying with a friend or family member! Coffee pot was much appreciated and the claw foot tub was super cute. An amazing value, could probably charge much more."
11253948,76919220,2016-05-29,5405369,Hannah,"While we didn't end up staying at this exact property due to some renovations wrapping up, our experience was very enjoyable! After assessing options with Peter, our group of 7 ended up staying at another Airbnb property through Peter which was gorgeous, newly renovated, and very spacious. Peter was very accessible, friendly, and willing to provide us with anything we needed. "
11253948,80860249,2016-06-20,34438401,Michael,A truly excellent experience with a host who was responsive and caring.

<br/>He was very communicative and easy to work with. Thanks for the stay!"
11253948,93980581,2016-08-14,78076864,Alix,"My friends and I needed a place to stay very quickly, and Piotr offered us this wonderful house. What a good surprise ! We didn't expect a place like this. The house is amazing, so beautiful, with everything that we need.... It was a great pleasure to spend the night in it, for sure we would have stayed much longer if we didn't have to go right away.  
<br/>Moreover, Piotr was an excellent host. Very kind and helpful. Thank you !"
11253948,99472843,2016-09-05,56222904,Owen,"Piotr is an excellent, efficient and welcoming host. He was prompt at arrival, even letting us in a few hours before his hosted check in time. This stay was for business, and he made my employees feel comfortable, private and well-taken care of. This is a beautiful property and the pictures and amenity lists are quite accurate. A wonderful host, and an excellent place to stay for business or pleasure in the the Capital Region."
11253948,102256212,2016-09-17,3675342,Rodrigo,"Piotr was a great host. Met us at the house when he said he would and was super friendly. The house was not only clean, but very well maintained and manicured. We loved the plants! We were in Albany for a conference and it was nice to stay in this lovely house. Could use some furniture on the back deck, but otherwise it was a great stay. Thanks, Piotr!"
11253948,102561016,2016-09-18,68278010,Max,Piotr was a wonderful host! He was readily available at all times and made us feel welcome as soon as we arrived.

He was extremely accommodating and flexible - communication was great. <br/>The bungalow was even better than described and had everything we needed. It is a work in progress but very well done and very comfortable. <br/>The location is excellent too - very convenient. <br/>I can't recommend it highly enough - one of our best AirBnB experiences. 
11253948,103681826,2016-09-23,87120682,Neil,"Great place! Piotr was very accommodating and the house is fantastic. Plenty of room, many, many amenities (the bottled water and snacks were a very nice touch), clean, updated. Oh, the bed in the ""master"" BR is heavenly! He's done a great job with this listing. I was especially appreciative of his willingness to accommodate us for only one night - especially when the house could also have held a larger group. It was great to be able to return to Albany, however briefly, and catch up with old friends in such comfort."

It had everything we needed and things we didn't expect - towel warmers and great tvs. The beds were super comfortable, with down comforters and lovely, soft sheets. The location is on a quiet street that makes it easy to access local highways. Best of all, the host is a wonderful communicator who always answered us quickly, graciously and thoughtfully. We highly recommend Piotr and this Airbnb!"
11253948,123953710,2016-12-31,30597032,Lynn,"This property is a treasure. Piotr has the place completely renovated, and he uses environmentally friendly , sustainable products. The bedding is high end, much like a luxury hotel. I would highly recommend Piotr's bnb, restful luxury at a reasonable price."

It is a keyless entry so there were no keys to fuss with. Peter did not bother us, he left us alone unless we had questions or needed something. Peter not only provided the basics in the home, he went above and beyond even supplying the laundry products!<br/>We will definitely stay there again when we go back home to visit family!"

11253948,220266376,2017-12-21,127920770,Haotian,房子靠近SUNY，上学非常方便，而且非常安静且安全。房子内的各项设施都十分完备，完全不需要客人操心。很感激Peter无微不至的照顾，我和我的朋友在Peter的这座房子里住了长达四个月的时间，在Albany的这四个月是我们非常珍贵的回忆。

The house was clean and comfortable.  Location is excellent with easy access to all around Albany and lots of convenient stores nearby.  Big TV in the living room with plenty of seating.  The kitchen is a fun 50's style with modern appliances.  It was a great base for our activities."
11253948,266746197,2018-05-20,41039235,Cynthia,This is a lovely little house. It is homey and super comfortable. Over the years I have switched rooms or hotels because of dirty areas. Piotr’s house is very clean and tidy. The floors and stairs are beautifully shined. I thought the stairs would be slippery but they are not at all!  <br/>Appliances are new.  Sonos sound system available for large screen TV.  One block away from busy street with drugstore and restaurants. However the house is very quiet <br/>Outside the back door there is a 2 story deck that is great for entertaining. We had a party of 10 and all fit there comfortably.  <br/>Loved this house and would definitely stay here again.
11253948,272523536,2018-06-03,58862610,Tara,The house was extremely clean and the beds/pillows were incredibly comfortable! The host even provided us with a pack-n-play for our 16 month old son when we asked. We really appreciated that all of the light switches in the house were even labeled.

11253948,301688926,2018-08-04,15908295,Shaloma,"Piotr is a fantastic host and the property is perfect! Great location with ample parking and shops, university, and even church nearby. The house is extremely well-kept and clean, with top-of-the-line amenities. The beds were very comfortable. Everything you need is supplied, even a Sonos system and flat-screen TVs,  acoustic guitar, and poker chips available for those interested. Piotr responded very quickly to texts and requests. When we asked if there was a rice cooker before coming, we saw there was a new one supplied when we arrived. When we couldn't find two parts to a blender, he supplied us with a new, top-of-the-line Ninja blender. Other than an extremely comfortable in-doors area, the back deck and front porches are lovely. I highly recommend Piotr and this property, and will certainly plan on renting from him again when I need to be in Albany. Now I understand the definition of a super host. Thanks for an amazing stay, Piotr!"
11253948,304451961,2018-08-09,13073451,Sara,"The Eden bungalow provides all the comforts of home and we really enjoyed our stay.  Located in a quiet neighborhood, it has a lovely porch, deck and yard to enjoy.  Piotr is a great host and has everything functioning beautifully so you can focus on your activities and spend minimal time figuring out how things work.  The house is clean and well-maintained.  Having multiple bathrooms and flexible sleeping arrangements worked well for our group.  So glad we chose this place and would definitely stay again."
11253948,358740995,2018-12-15,93674486,Katinka,"We stayed at Peter's place for 4 months and everything was amazing. The place is lovely, the location is perfect to get to the bus station, cvs and UAlbany and Peter was a great host. Really felt like home. :)"

The light switches are labeled which is very convenient. Lots of great amenities, even stuff like blenders, washer and dryer which is great. There’s TVs in each room and the sound system is great. The only thing it needs is blinds curtains on some of the windows."
11253948,430389232,2019-03-30,121098709,Kirk,We had a great day. The house is nice and well-appointed. It is also within walking distance to some restaurants and amenities. Overall a terrific location and a great host!

11253948,445040346,2019-04-28,2948874,Teru,"It’s a clean, compact house close to the university campus, and generally as advertised, but just be advised to check the photos and “additional fees” carefully.<br/>one of the 3 bedrooms doesn’t have a wall/door — it’s a space partitioned from the living room with a curtain, so it’s not super private and not at all sound proof. <br/>it’s listed as 7 beds, but extra charges do kick in if there’s more than 4 guests."
11253948,452060579,2019-05-12,116154363,Anne-Marie,"Great stay at Piotr’s place. Clean, comfortable, convenient."

We found that Piotr had everything we needed when it came to cooking and being comfortable for the weekend. It is within walking distance to a 24 hour CVS, Rite Aid, restaurants, a bus stop to go downtown, and SUNY Albany. It felt like a home away from home. If we are ever in the area again, I will definitely stay here. Thank you!!"
11253948,459451848,2019-05-27,45034974,Sarah & Jim,What a nice place for a family to stay. Do you need a place that has space and accessibility? This bungalow doesn’t disappoint! The renovations are well done and add charm and modernization to the home. It is situated in a residential neighborhood with multi generation and cultural feel. Walking distance to eats and quick cvs run. The place was clean and welcoming
11253948,462865883,2019-06-02,74848229,Powell,"This bungalow is a comfortable, well-equipped house in a quiet neighborhood, with the multiple bedrooms our family needed, and also the bonus of outdoor spaces for relaxing.

11253948,499505164,2019-07-31,266529012,Daniel,"The kitchen has everything you may need for cooking.  The  living room is very clean and nice.   But the windows in the room on the 2nd floor may not be good to protect the noise from outside if you are sensitive to noises, and there was no curtain in the window of the bathroom on the 2nd floor.  And I paid too much almost $600 for 2 days stay.  In overall, the house is good, but I felt the price was too expensive."
11253948,501476692,2019-08-03,49379773,Mark,"A lovely place to stay with a great open concept inside, comfortable front porch, and large deck on the back."

The backyard was also incredibly peaceful and the beds were very comfy! I’d fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow every time. Everything was very clean and everything about this stay was exceptional! Thanks again for the amazing hospitality!
11253948,591528045,2020-01-11,79932266,Stephanie,Peter was an amazing host!  We rented three different homes from him during a work projection Albany.

Not only is it more affordable than room and board, it offers so much more- utensils, smart TVs, clean and new appliances, etc. Peter was a very attentive host and we were more than satisfied with our stay! For getaways or longer term rentals, this house will fit your every need!"
11253948,633632989,2020-06-30,2363863,Miranda,"This place is fantastic — quiet house in a walkable neighborhood, with fantastic appliances and top notch WiFi. Eagle Hill is lovely — a great place to walk around. There’s a pond right across Western Avenue that I walked at every morning — beautiful. Peter was an excellent host, and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed for a perfect stay. Would stay here again any time!"

Really nice deck outside to hang out on. I especially liked the view in the back yard of the pretty church behind the property.  So much nicer than seeing other houses. Cheerful flowers planted in front yard and in big pots near the deck. Very nice welcoming touch.  Our dogs were comfortable and relaxed in the house right away and there was even a nice sized fenced in area in the yard for them, with shade.   We highly recommend Peter as a host and the house is a great place to spend time in. Not to mention a super convenient location within walking distance to restaurants, shops and Albany U."
11253948,765644862,2021-06-02,2126994,Andres,Amazing Amazing Amazing.  Place was great. Peter was very attentive and responded relatively quickly to any of our questions.

It would have been impossible to find anything else nearly this nice or convenient that allowed our pets. Everything is new, modern and clean. Anything you could possibly need in a pinch is there somewhere and if it’s not, Peter is always available to help. I especially appreciated the basement storage room, the 2 washer/dryer sets, the huge new fridge, all the big windows for my houseplants and the dog yard. My family appreciated the abundance of takeout food choices and the big bedroom TV’s. The gas fireplace is beautiful and so cozy! It couldn’t have been a better experience."

Stayed here as a couple for a last minute overnight and it was about the same cost as a hotel but so much better value! Super clean and cozy. The home is conveniently located a stone’s throw from many retail and restaurant spots, and is pretty close to the highway. Peter was friendly, responsive, and super accommodating. We loved our little stay!!"

11253948,916654107545883886,2023-06-18,144885940,Danny,"Peter was awesome and the place was incredible. Brand new HUGE tv (like 80 inches), comfortable beds with soft linens, clean bathrooms complete with 5 different body washes to choose from, TV’s in each bedroom, private area in backyard to hang out, new appliances in kitchen — it literally has everything you can think of. By far my favorite Airbnb I have stayed in. We booked this place last minute on our drive up to albany because our hotel cancelled our reservation and Peter responded quickly and saved the day. Highly recommend staying here if you are going to a show at SPAC in Saratoga. The Uber is like 30-35 minutes to the venue, but you can’t beat the house. Also the bagel place Common Ground is right around the corner and is incredible. We grabbed breakfast there on our way out of town and I got a great bagel and cold brew for $6"

My cousin and I were very entertained by the lighting options both inside and out. The TV in the living room was perfect and all of the rooms had nice big TVs as well. Super comfy bed and an amazing light up makeup mirror upstairs. All the amenities were super modern. A cute fireplace and A/C. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Peter!"

We especially appreciated the well-stocked kitchen and the fact that it was pet friendly. The weather didn't really cooperate in terms of enjoying the outside spaces, but both the front porch and the back deck/yard seem like lovely places to relax and unwind after a busy day. Peter's place was the perfect location for connecting with family and friends around the capital district and we loved how walkable it was as well. We made numerous trips to Uncommon Grounds, CVS, and, my favorite, Ted's Fish Fry. There were many other options to choose from, and we may be back :). <br/>Kim and Grant"

Very clean and recently updated.<br/>Our only issue was that the listing states 6 beds but the two single beds described do not exist.   The host added an air mattress for us so we were able to make it work, but it wasn’t ideal for our group."

11639446,77422841,2016-05-31,64884002,Linda,"I booked a room with Adam for a visiting scientist who was working in our lab for two months.  Adam was a gracious host and made sure that my co-worker was well fed and comfortable.  Thank you Adam for providing him a 'home away from home'.  What follows is a review from my co-worker who stayed with Adam...
<br/>""My two months stay at Adam's house was awesome. I just can't describe it. It far exceeded my expectations. Adam was a father, a guide, very friendly and always ready to help. He was very concerned about my security and made sure I was always safe. I enjoyed the good food that he prepared for me morning, afternoon and evening. He provided me with everything I needed. My room was regularly cleaned and clothes regularly washed. Adam really treated me well and I will always stay at his place anytime I'm in the Albany area. I recommend his house to anyone coming to the Albany area.  I really thank Adam for allowing me to stay in his house during my time in Albany. God bless you Adam."""
11639446,79084674,2016-06-11,75297695,Serena,"Adam was a very gracious host. He picked me up from the airport at an obscenely late hour after my flight was delayed. He was also very generous in providing delicious and nutritious food made to order (the room is above a cafe that Adam also owns and runs). The room itself was adequate. Do bring earplugs as you will be sleeping below some very talkative pigeons who occupy the rooftop. The bathroom and kitchen facilities are not luxurious; more like a college crash pad. But if you can handle the urban rustic vibe, you'll be very satisfied with your stay. The location is also very convenient by bus or taxi to other parts of the city. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Adam!"
11639446,79534403,2016-06-13,76846756,Dan,"Adam offers a fantastic value: lodging and three meals for under 50 dollars.
<br/>
<br/>Adam made me feel very welcome. His home is upstairs from a storefront restaurant. He prepares all the meals himself, and offers quite a choice for his guests.
<br/>
<br/>The home is older, and has some rough edges, but clean and comfortable. Run the shower a bit so it gets hot, and you are all set.
<br/>
<br/>The neighborhood feels sketchy, which probably accounts for the very affordable rate. Off street parking. 
<br/>
<br/>I will definitely return."
11639446,79956613,2016-06-15,76036263,Jennie,"Adam was super accommodating about my veganism.  He offered me many choices for dinner.  I asked for rice & beans -- it was expertly spiced, really delicious!  He packed a lunch for me in the morning with yummy lentil & onion that he also made.  Food was so good!
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is old and a bit dirty in places, but the room itself was well kept, the bed and blankets were clean, and the hot water in the shower worked well.   The main downside to the room was the birds that are on the other side of the wall of the room (pets?) -- they can be a bit loud and will wake you up early.
<br/>
<br/>Overall a nice experience for my first airbnb stay.  I would recommend this place to backpackers and travelers."
11639446,80224029,2016-06-17,68287769,Xavier,"I was up in Albany for business and only needed the room to sleep and clean off. Adam was a great host. The meals included in the price of the room was simple but tasty and healthy. The house is quiet and basic, the room has a key lock. You can park in the rear of the house. The neighborhood seemed quiet during the time I was there and I felt safe enough to run to the federal plaza in the morning. Overall this was a good experience, first AirBnB stay but probably not the last."
11639446,86010142,2016-07-14,66850809,Erica,"Adam was a great host! Very kind, very willing to supply what I needed. The room was adorable. It was good fun staying at his place!"
11639446,87013628,2016-07-18,38017885,Mark,Adam was very friendly and was waiting for me when I arrived.  His meals are delicious and will stay there if I am back in the Albany area.
11639446,88021455,2016-07-22,6002439,Whitney,Very welcoming and accommodating.  
11639446,89431493,2016-07-28,79467883,Vaiben,"Great stay. Adam was very generous in providing meals, transport and anything else I needed during my stay"
11639446,93102834,2016-08-11,18725433,Jennifer,"I really appreciated that Adam had availability and was so accommodating at a last minute booking. He picked me up from the airport which was great. It seems that he tries to cater to his guests and facilitate their trip/visit in any way he can. An excellent host. Great to meet you Adam, Sam."
11639446,93111903,2016-08-11,80463590,Devon,"Adam was my first AirBNB experience and I am pretty sure that he will be my best. Adam was nice enough to stay at the airport for an extra 45 minutes to pick me up (after my flight was delayed). He cooks outstanding food subject to your tastes / allergies / food restrictions. He was also nice enough to drive me to downtown Albany for a business meeting (and pick me up). He also drove me back to the airport for my departure. 
<br/>
<br/>The room is small, but it is great for a single person. With the room, you get free food cooked by Adam, towels, blankets, a small toothbrush / toothpaste package, and use of the cafe area anytime you want (if you had work to do like me). There is also parking in the back. 
<br/>
<br/>Adam's food is healthy and great. For lunch, I had a baked potato stuffed with vegetables. For dinner, a chicken and rice dish that he can make spicy. For breakfast, a good tomato and egg breakfast with toast. He also made me a quick sandwich to take as I was rushing to catch my flight on the last day.
<br/>
<br/>As Adam notes in his post, the room is not the Ritz Carlton or Club Med. However, if you are traveling by yourself, it is an outstanding deal. Honestly, for the price of one night here (combined with everything Adam gives you) is slightly cheaper than a cab fare to and from downtown Albany. Thus, the value that you get here is amazing. 
<br/>
<br/>Finally, Adam is just a nice and friendly guy. He has an outstanding life story and was a pleasure to talk to. All around, a great experience! If I am every in the Albany area, I would definitely choose this listing again. Thanks, Adam!
<br/>
<br/>P.S. Try his Turkish Coffee! I was tired after all my work and flying. After having that coffee, I have never felt more awake throughout the day. Great stuff indeed. "
11639446,95503780,2016-08-20,88220010,Alison,"Adam was an amazing host, and made my first AirBnB experience wonderful. The food he cooked was absolutely delicious,  and he made it based on my diet. The room was clean and comfortable, perfect for relaxing after work. While the neighborhood seems sketchy, it's very quiet. I felt perfectly safe there, and felt very comfortable leaving my car parked in his back lot all week. Adam goes above and beyond to see that his guests are comfortable and happy. Wish I had been able to stay here for another week!"
11639446,96118437,2016-08-21,22708792,Jess,"Adam was a great host, going above and beyond with meals special made just for me and to go lunches! Warm and welcoming, would stay again!"
11639446,98350738,2016-08-30,77155916,Hayden,"David was super nice, accommodated me for dinner and took me to airport in the morning! Loved staying here "
11639446,99339374,2016-09-04,9700935,Daniel,"Adam was an extremely kind and gracious host. Great communication prior to my arrival and during my stay; he prepared a wonderful vegetarian dinner when i arrived and  woke up at 5 am to prepare me breakfast and lunch to go even when i asked him not to do so. He was very eager to help me with my flat tire and i felt very welcomed at his home. This was one the best AirBnB experience i had and i can't wait to visit again. 
<br/>Thank you Adam for your Kindness and Hospitality ! "
11639446,102274497,2016-09-17,38234435,Gary,Best Airbnb experience at a very affordable price. The organics meals were delicious and is a nice added bonus. Rooms was nice and cozy. I recommend a stay for anyone who needs a quick stay and quality meals.
11639446,104135735,2016-09-25,52802072,Swami,If you're a foodie and want to try nice vegetarian meals don't miss this place. Place is generally quite and very accessible via bus. Adam makes sure you're satisfied with the experience 
11639446,104798414,2016-09-28,5803027,Jason,"Adam is truly a wonderful person. He not only prepared my delicious meals, but also did my laundry in such a fantastic fashion that is way beyond my imagination. I had amazing experience in Adam's place. "
11639446,106691295,2016-10-07,12844657,C,I'm a returning customer and was equally satisfied as my first time. He truly is the very best and one and only for sure. Book your stay here to see for yourself.
11639446,107169932,2016-10-09,1691996,Karen,"Adam was such a kind, attentive host! He truly does things from the kindness of his heart and expects nothing in return. My friend couldn't accommodate me but when she and I went hiking, he prepared an extra to-go lunch and snack pack for her! His cooking is wonderful. Try his baklava if you can! It's not overly sweet like most baklava. The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable enough. I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in town!"
11639446,107815468,2016-10-12,5803027,Jason,"I came back the second time, once again the great experience, from the food Adam prepared to picking up at the train station, everything was smooth and well-done. "
11639446,145325193,2017-04-17,65472397,Izzy,Simple and easy to work with. Good food and extremely accomodating
11639446,145929786,2017-04-20,19498399,L,"Adam is very hospitable.  He likes what he does and his business is gaining momentum by offering more services than just a bed and a stocked fridge.  He enjoys people, likes to share his native cooking and is very generous in offering free transportation.  As a Turkish immigrant running a business in the US, one can only imagine what hoops Adam has gone through to provide a safe, caring, courteous overnight stay for his international clientele in Albany's locale.  I wish him continued success.   "
11639446,148748797,2017-05-01,17476830,Elisabeth,I have stayed many times at Adam's place and would stay there again.
11639446,149100257,2017-05-02,43668553,Julia,"Absolutely fabulous does not begin to describe staying with Adam. He was so flexible about my arrival and had dinner set and waiting for me on my arrival despite it being later in the evening. His warm and courtly hospitality are from another era. <br/>My room was quite comfortable with a twin bed. It is an older building but everything was very clean. <br/>Despite leaving at an early hour, Adam also made me breakfast which was stunningly delicious and he packed me a lunch to take with me as well. <br/>I wouldn't stay anywhere else besides at Adams in coming to Albany. "
11639446,149950438,2017-05-06,45320519,Rusty,I stated Adam's place for a week. He was such a great host and cook me some great food. The room was simple but clean the whole house is clean I couldn't of asked for anything more. I think most of all items that Adam made me every morning. 10/10 would stay again.
11639446,151046229,2017-05-10,19498399,L,"Knowledgeable about nutritional and dietary concerns affecting health, an excellent cook who uses organic or natural foods and an attentive host who focuses on providing a memorable stay including ground transportation which makes booking with this airb&b easy."
11639446,151353086,2017-05-12,17199923,Sam,Adam is a wonderful host. He offered me lifts whenever he was free and even cooked for me a couple of times! More than anyone could expect from airbnb. Thanks Adam!
11639446,151944382,2017-05-14,107265523,Ian,would stay again!
11639446,152298312,2017-05-15,126791970,Ed,"Adam was a great host for my one night stay. Clean room, hot shower, WiFi and a great Turkish style breakfast. I would highly recommend staying."
11639446,152487649,2017-05-16,51576967,Cal,Adam is very nice and atentative.<br/>He goes the extra mile in trying to make his guests feel comfortable and enjoy their stay. Breakfast is<br/>tasty! Great stay!<br/>
11639446,152661678,2017-05-17,24618930,Francois,Adam goes above and beyond and has the best Airbnb value in town. Highly recommended!
11639446,153580356,2017-05-21,48164387,Alan,Adam was an incredible host. He picked me up from the bus station and made delicious breakfast each morning. I highly recommend staying here if you're in Albany. 
11639446,175585658,2017-07-29,96659049,Alexander,I was here for a ~3 months internship. Location was perfect about a 10 min drive to the touristy part of Albany and 15 min away from work. Work started at 7 am for me and Adam kindly had breakfast waiting at 6 am every morning to start my day. He cleans the house regularly and provides laundry service. There are often new guests coming in so it's a great way to get to know new people and make new friends from all over the world. Can't really beat the price for the location/food/amenities!
11639446,178050522,2017-08-04,113521,Ja,"Adam is a caring host, a gentle guy, and a great cook.  It was a great stay and very close to the bus stop for an easy commute downtown or the riverfront with no transfers required.  We wouldn't hesitate to pick Adam's  place again!"
11639446,178982282,2017-08-06,13352295,Renna,"Adam's place is so unique, in all the best ways. The food - terrific! The room I had was simple, but exactly what I needed for a comfortable night. (Note: Since so many of us depend on our electronic devices now for GPS and communications, I wish more hosts would provide a power strip - Adam does!) He's an engaged and caring host, and I felt so well cared for... what a treat after too many hours driving. I'd gladly return - Thanks, Adam!"
11639446,179450689,2017-08-07,139913449,Natalie,"Adam is an incredibly generous host! A++ service and value. My room was not particularly fancy, but plenty comfortable. The meals and unexpected ""bonuses"" (a sweet gift, a ride from the airport, help carrying my very heavy bag around...even at 4am) made my visit extra special. I truly look forward to staying at Adam's again!"
11639446,179834908,2017-08-08,137927959,Dheeraj,Adam is a great host. I have never seen such a kind and reliable host before. The food itself worth for what you pay. I would definitely visit his place again. 
11639446,182874539,2017-08-15,105727443,Martin,Staying in Adam's room was really nice. It was all what you need for one or two night. His food which he cooked for me was fabulous.
11639446,183212990,2017-08-16,53892029,Kendall,"I know that sometimes Airbnb guests tend to get a little flowery or repetitive with their reviews, but you ought to believe every glowing review you read of Adam's place.<br/>The place was very well kept and Adam was an incredibly gracious, gentle, and attentive host. I think what really impressed me the most were the details. My towel was wrapped in plastic, there was a makeup mirror in the room (not that it was much use to me, but I could still appreciate its utility), the fan was on when I got there, Adam personally stood out in the street when I was backing my car out. When it was time for me to check out at 6 a.m., he had a bagged breakfast and lunch ready for me to take. <br/>Adam's got a real heart for hospitality and the only thing I wish I could have changed was my own schedule so I could've stayed longer. I hope I get the chance to come back."
11639446,184429306,2017-08-19,283,Immanuel,Adam is a fantastic host and his place provides amazing value for money. I felt very comfortable at his place and would stay again when I'm in Albany next. Highly recommended!
11639446,188191825,2017-08-28,2039476,Cynta,"This is a true hostel.  Inexpensive.  Great host.  Four bathrooms for 5 rooms of various sizes.  Big kitchen upstairs and Adam is prepared to cook for everyone 3 meals a day downstairs.  Adam is inspiring because he is everything here: housekeeper, cook, launderer, consierge, chauffer.  Besides that, Adam is a hoot.  If I have to come back to Albany next year, I'm staying here."
11639446,188519644,2017-08-29,147194670,Zachariah,"Adam's place was awesome. So nice meeting the guy and spending an evening. I went to work on a project in private and Adam was extremely accomadating. I got a lot of work done, and Adam made me a spinach and rice dish and special dessert that honestly left me feeling refreshed and balanced. The place is quaint and welcoming. I put 4 stars for location because the area is a bit edgy. Nevertheless I have an open mind and was able to meet a nice neighbor and enjoyed a walk to a nearby park. Adam is very dedicated to this, as his cafe downstairs is purely for his guests! This was really eye opening to me. Adam obviously values giving and passion over profit and I value him for that."
11639446,188767549,2017-08-30,48097040,Tuck,Adam has been very helpful to make sure that I am comfortable. The food is great and you can have the choice to meet your diet need. He makes sure that I have lunch packed for my trip out.
11639446,190522174,2017-09-04,52264378,Kaitlyn,"Wonderful hospitality-- especially in the little things.  Every morning, Adam makes a delicious breakfast and even packs a lunch for you to take.  He stood beside the driveway to help direct me, even in the rain, without being asked! There is even an assortment of adorable earrings he gifts you for your stay.  Will be coming back whenever I stay in Albany. Thanks again!"
11639446,191481253,2017-09-07,33272531,Ellie,"Adam is a nice man who is extremely attentive and caring. He goes beyond what other hosts do. He waits for your arrival each day and sees you off in the morning. He has breakfast, lunch, and dinner ready for you upon your arrival. The meals are absolutely delicious!"
11639446,192618080,2017-09-10,436398,Brian,"I've been in 70 countries, every state of the US, stayed in 1-5 star motels, hotels, B&Bs, roach hotels, hostels, basically everywhere. Adam's place is an incredible bargain, the value cannot be beat. He is perfectly located for Albany - very central. While the rooms are small and very basic, in an old house and you'll have communal bathrooms, they'll do just fine. They are clean and he provides 3 meals/day; you'll get a bag lunch if you are out. If you like to try different cuisines, are health conscious and want a friendly, more than accommodating host and particularly if you are on a budget, this place is for you. Adam himself is older, but very intelligent. His passion is what he is doing now and he enjoys it. If you visit, you will read many of the notes others have left behind and it will lift your spirits in mankind! I definitely recommend it!"
11639446,194317641,2017-09-16,69888996,Joy,Adam is one of the best cooks I've met! He not only makes dinner for you but also packs lunches. I was in town for an exam and didn't have to worry about bringing food/snacks. Thanks Adam!
11639446,195523491,2017-09-19,19471387,Stephanie,"Adam is an extremely kind and gracious host who pays attention to the details! Home cooked meals, clean towels and linens, and a secure parking spot in a central location. I look forward to staying here again."
11639446,195984385,2017-09-21,14588518,Chris,"It was exactly as advertised. The bed was comfy, and I really liked the building/it's age showed. Adam was a nice guy and a great cook. The food alone is worth staying here for."
11639446,196562306,2017-09-23,28230591,Naveen,Adam is a kind and welcoming host. The food he prepares is very good. Perfect place to stay in a convenient location.
11639446,197145569,2017-09-24,64919343,Pavel,"Adam is the best host, I went to Albany to a concert and when the concert ended he picked me up very kindly and took me home. The next day he also took me to the bus station even though it was very early and he prepared me something to eat for the road.  I seriously recommend staying at Adam's house when you go to Albany. :)"
11639446,197459986,2017-09-25,5340182,Natalia,"It's $35 a night with 3 free meals. Come on. You can't beat that. It's no 5 star place. It's a 100 year old house and feels like it in every way, but Adam works very hard to keep you comfortable and full! He even gave me a ride to my friend's wedding saving me $20 on an uber ride! So it's a rough place at a great price and lots of free food. Think hostel not hotel with a very personal and generous touch."
11639446,197983858,2017-09-27,19471387,Stephanie,always a great stay at Adam’s
11639446,199330213,2017-10-01,824452,Will,"I remember visiting Edgar Cayce's hospital on Virginia Beach and learned how the ""sleeping prophet"" healed seriously ill patients with rest and nutrition. Adam's place felt salubrious in that in a Edgar Cayce way. I enjoyed three meals high in flavor and spice and low in sodium, perfect for a man under treatment for high blood pressure. I found myself picking up ideas for simple, breezy, inexpensive meals low in sodium. His Turkish Scrambled Eggs might cure a wide range of maladies.<br/>My room was beautiful in monastic simplicity and I found myself taking more rest than I had planned. I found books to read and I slept a sleep of musey dreams, waking filled with ideas for my writing. The cafe on the first floor, drinking vibrant coffee, gave me a place to put my musings into words.<br/>I feel healthier, healed of some malady of which I know not the name."
11639446,200788376,2017-10-06,3227395,Khoa,"Adam is a consummate host! He truly goes above and beyond to make you feel like you're coming home. Upon my arrival, he came out to my car and directed me to his off street parking himself. Waiting for me was a warm dinner. He later asked what time I would prefer breakfast to be served, noting that an early time wasn't an issue (I had an early interview). Upon my leaving, what did I get? A packed lunch. Even as a grown man, I felt touched by that extra care. Please do yourself a favor and stay here. You'll be with a great host. I know I'll only stay here the next time I'm in Albany. Thanks again Adam!"
11639446,201087623,2017-10-07,43049384,Saima,"I enjoyed my short stay at Adam's place -- the food he prepared had great favors and taste, and he took a lot of care to prepare and provide the food based on my schedule. The place was quiet and safe, and close to local attractions such as museums."
11639446,201649215,2017-10-08,135083121,Catherine,"I am so grateful for the experience of staying here-- Adam is an amazing host who truly cares for his guests. He's also a fantastic cook and is very mindful of dietary restrictions, which is something I usually have to worry about when I travel. I hope I have a chance to visit his airbnb again soon!"
11639446,202506928,2017-10-11,19471387,Stephanie,Another great stay at Adam’s place!
11639446,203255252,2017-10-14,135083121,Catherine,"This was my second stay with Adam- he really goes above and beyond to make sure his guests have an outstanding stay. He made it much easier to plan my trip and took the stress out of traveling. His airbnb description is quite humble, but as long as you care more about personality and character than some of the things a fancy hotel can offer, then you won't be disappointed. I've been at nice hotels that had worse physical conditions that didn't offer any of the sense of community, caring, or hospitality that Adam shares with his guests."
11639446,204123691,2017-10-16,88674608,Xingbang,The best place in the state! This is my second visit. Adam is so kind. He picked me up at greyhound station even though I arrived very late by 1:30am. The food is fantastic. Surprised that he still remember me after six months! He is a friend than a host!
11639446,204738605,2017-10-19,797914,New,"I always try to stay with Adam when I'm in town. He is so helpful in making sure I get to my destinations since I'm unfamiliar with the area. Thanks again Adam, and I'm sure I will see you again on my next trip."
11639446,206483816,2017-10-25,28230591,Naveen,Adam is the perfect host. His food is extremely good. He is always there to help with anything. My favorite place to stay in Albany.
11639446,207985351,2017-10-30,112028367,Anamaria,"Adam was the bright spot in a stressful situation for me. I was traveling alone for an intense 3 day test to a place I've never been without my family. Adam was sooo kind. He picked me up from the airport with a snack despite delays and a super late arrival, made me delicious warm meals for breakfast and dinner, packed me a sack lunch and drove me daily to the test site with a gracious Good Luck! And then took me back to the airport on my departure. I can't say enough thank yous!!! He was an amazing host! This was my first time using AirBnB. I'm not sure there can be his equal after this."
11639446,209171677,2017-11-04,129125336,Kaylee,Overall great place! Great location! Great room! GREAT FOOD! Loved everything about it!
11639446,210106505,2017-11-07,95195222,Georgia,All the reviews on this host and Airbnb experience were on point. You will not get the service provided by Adam anywhere. He is thoughtful and kind and has really thought of everything one would need to feel at home. Adam loves what he does and you and tell in all the details he has placed in caring for his guests. The food is fantastic and individualized! He even picked me up from Greyhound and dropped me off to an appointment. I️ mean come on?? You will not find this type of care anywhere. Thanks again Adam for everything you did for me!!!
11639446,210898715,2017-11-11,40987019,Adam,This place is amazing!  Adam’s place is truly unique and his hospitality is the best there is.  I will definitely stay again!
11639446,219904411,2017-12-19,40987019,Adam,"This place is amazing!  This is the second time I've stayed with Adam and I will definitely be back.   The bed is comfortable, the food is delicious, and the hospitality is second to none.   If you are going to stay in Albany especially for a longer period of time you should look to stay with Adam!"
11639446,249672003,2018-04-02,40987019,Adam,"Ok this place is my favorite Airbnb I've ever been to.  It's nothing like your expecting, and I have to say Adam is the definition of what an outstanding host is.  Now don't get me wrong it's not the Ritz but it is a unique one of a kind experience, and if you keep an open mind there is no way you will be disappointed.  I can't wait to stay there again!"
11639446,250308809,2018-04-04,897083,Chuck,"It's hard to beat $35 a night including breakfast.  It's no secluded getaway for sure.  But the room is clean, Adam is very nice, and the price can't be beat.  It's not in the best part of town but you've got off street parking so that's a major plus given the area.  It's also right across the street from the Mexican Market which has fantastic tacos for super cheap.  I would definitely recommend it if you're on a tight budget."
11639446,254887207,2018-04-18,47068045,Melvin,He made eggs in the morning with lemon cake and coffee. IT WAS SOOOO GOOD and he made me lunch to go with it!?!?!? Superb AirBnb Host. The Best.
11639446,255440351,2018-04-20,47068045,Melvin,"Once again, Adam kills it with his great Hospitality. His eggs for breakfast are great and his lunches as well. Best place to stay for the price!"
11639446,258141495,2018-04-28,28230591,Naveen,Adam's place is the best place to stay around Albany. Great hospitality and great food. He is very quick in responding to requests. Enjoyed my stay fully.
11639446,260660328,2018-05-04,154377057,Michelle,"Adam's place is a great value for the money and Adam is an exceptional host. I arrived late on my trip to Albany but Adam was so graciously kind and picked me up from the Greyhound bus station. As he walked me to my room he asked me what time I would be up for breakfast the next day. Certainly as the next day approached and I went downstairs my breakfast was sitting at the table with a small sign that read ""Lady Michelle"". The breakfast prepared was very good and I especially enjoyed my cake he serves with each breakfast. When I was done Adam asked me what time I needed to be at work and offered me a ride to work each day. My stay with Adam was amazing, as I found him to be a humble, thoughtful and kind individual, who cares more about being hospitable than he does money....ppl like him are a rare find! If in Albany I would highly recommend staying at Adam's, his place was clean, comfortable, in a great location and worth every cent. God bless him."
11639446,263277818,2018-05-11,154377057,Michelle,"Adam is a great host, my second stay with him. He is friendly, generious, kind and my stay with him was awesome....can't beat his price or hospitality. I would stay again!"
11639446,265880377,2018-05-18,44241216,Johannes,"Adam ist ein wunderbarer Gastgeber. Antwortete superschnell auf meine spontane Anfrage, fuhr mich abends noch ins Stadtzentrum, hat ein leckeres Frühstück und obendrein ein Lunchpaket zurecht gemacht."
11639446,266215717,2018-05-19,189988582,Garrett,"The room is great (exactly as advertised),  and in an area surrounded by great places to eat. Adam is a great host and even had breakfast ready for me @ 4:30 am! Definitely would book again."
11639446,267335791,2018-05-21,154377057,Michelle,"Adam's place is worth every bit for the value. I have stayed at Adam's place twice before and he is awesome, he responds quickly, cooks awesome food and is just simply an awesome host! I will always book, so long as he has the availability."
11639446,270601226,2018-05-29,88674608,Xingbang,"Adam is the greatest host in the world, very generous and always trying to help! He is the part of my recognition to Albany! He made me love the city!"
11639446,270857132,2018-05-30,191372380,Jana-Andrea,"Adam was an incredibly wonderful host. My trip to Albany was very spontanous, but it was no problem and he replied very fast. Adam picked me up from the bus station and brought me back the next morning. He prepaired a delious dinner, breakfast and lunch package for me. You can't expect more from an airbnb for this price. Adam is a really special person who cares for everything you need. :)"
11639446,272527067,2018-06-03,191455697,Tianhong,"Adam runs his business professionally, it just like a small hotel. The building has about 100 years history, it makes me felt like went back to 100 years ago, so fantastic! Adam provided me breakfast and lunch every day, more than I expected.  The fried egg for breakfast is very delicious, and the lunch for each day is deferent. I am so glad to have such a wonderful experience there. Thank you, Adam."
11639446,274185707,2018-06-08,154377057,Michelle,Adam once again has been an awesome and gracious host who goes above and beyond.....what can I say another great stay!
11639446,274604311,2018-06-09,36903508,Howard,"Every host should take a leaf out of Adam's book. He doesn't have the biggest, the most luxurious or the most modern B&B but he is honest with his description and he is meticulous with his preparation. He is warm and caring and generous to a fault. If you want something different stay with Adam."
11639446,275724630,2018-06-11,14903219,Alex,"Adam was a gracious host, and the communication was very good. Checked in late and left early, but Adam was very flexible and was easily reachable. Facilities are accurate to the description - don't expect hotel-quality amenities - but everything was as good or better than I was expecting. Adam provided breakfast in the morning, which was very good. Will definitely be back next time I pass through Albany."
11639446,281210186,2018-06-24,141599132,James,"Adam is nice, helpful, & everything you'd want in a host. Place is perfect for a few nights stay."
11639446,282501101,2018-06-27,6669591,Isabelita,Adam was an amazingly kind host! He cooked delicious meals and drove us from/to the airport. The place was very clean and comfortable. Totally recommended!
11639446,284428147,2018-07-01,178833309,Stephanie,"Adam, is everything you expect from a hostess. He is thoughtful, kind and very attentive to you. He helps you in anyway he can. I can't describe him more than just an excellent person. The bedroom is just what you need, comfortable bed, cleaned space and breakfast served every morning at any time. You will be surprise be his kindness. "
11639446,284958462,2018-07-02,91052269,Paul,"Adam is an exceptional host, super friendly, great communication and even picked me up and dropped me back to the bus station.<br/>Place is as described, so you know you’re not getting a luxurious stay, but comfortable (if a little warm), and great value for money.<br/>Would highly recommend"
11639446,286617312,2018-07-06,14903219,Alex,"Second time staying with Adam, and he delivered just as amazing a stay experience as the first time. Very gracious host - accommodating for strange times (i.e. leaving at 5 am). Will definitely be staying at this AirBnB whenever I'm in Albany. "
11639446,288372849,2018-07-09,4348299,Jared,Great affordable room and a very friendly and accommodating  host.
11639446,289122840,2018-07-11,128764218,Dmitriy,The place  is nice and  clean .  There are plenty of shops  and restaurants around.  Location is  OK .  
11639446,290053595,2018-07-13,161330591,Justin,The place was exactly as described and clean. Adam is an excellent host. 
11639446,291853704,2018-07-16,28457327,Jocelynn,"Adam was absolutely amazing. I've stayed at many bnbs but his hospitality and kindness was on completely different level. He was super sweet, literally a godsend in many ways."
11639446,292239892,2018-07-17,44851425,Joshua,Adam is a great host! He is a very thoughtful and kind person who goes above and beyond as a host!
11639446,292668048,2018-07-18,149825979,Cordez,"Adam is very hospitable and does everything he can to make his guests feel at home. There's and entire wall of postcards from previous guests to back that up, and even the other guest I talked to had great things to say. He actually does make you breakfast in the morning, which is why there are pics of menu's posted. The room itself was nice. If you're in town for a short stay, I'd recommend this place."
11639446,293074451,2018-07-19,107449247,Mike,"This is my second time staying at Adam’s, and he doesn’t disappoint! Kind, courteous  and willing to go the extra mile to accommodate all your needs. It’s a no brainer to book with Adam!"

11639446,296369613,2018-07-25,151240013,Xueling,"The house is just like what Adam described in Airbnb, not New but very clean and warm. And very happy to meet Adam, kind to his guests and provide what you need. Try his homemade delicious meals, they are really great! And he may pick you up to home when you arrive or need. Thanks for all."
11639446,301071480,2018-08-03,26443736,Joshua,"Adams place was super convenient with the off street parking, the food coop only being two blocks away and easy access to the highway. "
11639446,309731651,2018-08-18,201913711,Chika 千佳,完全に善意によってのみ経営なさっていると感じました。朝昼晩3食が美味しく、栄養バランスの取れたもので感動しました。ホスピタリティーは恐らくどんな超高級ホテルにも優るのではと思います。<br/>He owns his Airbnb with his hospitality. He was always great. You may see your second house in Albany. This is the room of super super super host. You don’t have any reasons for choosing other places in Albany. Excellent.
11639446,312984762,2018-08-24,28230591,Naveen,I frequently stay at Adam's place. Adam is a very great host. The food is great.<br/>The house is neat and tidy. Very calm location. Best place to stay in Albany. 
11639446,314342691,2018-08-26,169501957,Lindsay,Great! 
11639446,316643192,2018-08-31,168616659,Haruki,"日本人のために日本語のレビューを。アメリカ横断中に一泊のみ滞在しましたが、本当に素晴らしい宿です。洗濯・朝ごはん・駅までの迎え等、Airbnbに書いてすらない素晴らしい待遇をして下さいました。<br/>Albanyに泊まるなら、ぜひAdamさんの宿に泊まるべきです。<br/>（家には他のゲストの方が2,3人いますが、全く気にせず過ごせます）<br/>It was amazing host! Clean and safe room, delicious breakfast and definitely kind host. He even drives me to downtown and washed my clothes. I would recommend all travelers to stay his house. <br/>Thank you."
11639446,317082578,2018-09-01,25039153,Prokhor,"This is a great place! Adam is very kind and welcoming, and the food is just great. Thank you Adam! Спасибо Adam! За такие деньги вообще не найти ничего лучше. Плюс завтрак отличный. Кафе на первом этаже, комнаты на втором (один хозяин). В районе присутствуют гопники."
11639446,320959672,2018-09-09,67127449,Erico,Adam is definitively a super host! Great food as well!
11639446,322244533,2018-09-12,214822191,Ty,"It's quite cozy, warm environment and Adam is amazing host and very responsive. Though, the hood is quite dark and far away from Downtown or Lark Street. If you're a female visitor,  it'd be a little uncomfortable the neighbor. Compare to a very reasonable cost, this is the best place in Albany. Buses and Uber can take you anywhere."
11639446,322635613,2018-09-13,78833127,Annie,"I had a very pleasant stay. The room was clean, the breakfast was good, and Adam is very kind and hospitable. I would definitely stay here again."

11639446,329310200,2018-09-28,62889690,Alfred,Great place.  Adam prepares healthy food options for you to enjoy.  Thank you for a great stay.
11639446,331074829,2018-10-01,6299712,Gérald,Adam est un Homme d’une grande gentillesse et prévenance... sa cuisine est excellente et sa maison d’une grande propreté... tout cela dans une grande authenticité et simplicité... n’hésitez pas à vous arrêter... Merci Adam

11639446,332584307,2018-10-05,109306889,Stephen,Adam was one of the most helpful and courteous hosts I've met at AirBnB.
11639446,333696167,2018-10-07,87972035,Gregg,"Adam is a great host, made me feel at home during my stay and I enjoyed the unique extras like the organic breakfasts.<br/>I enjoyed talking with Adam, he went out of his way to help me with my luggage, parking and local attractions that I would be interested in.<br/>One of the best deals on air bnb I've experienced.<br/>~Namaste~"
11639446,335622990,2018-10-12,81952683,Ashley,Adam was a fantastic host!
11639446,336667314,2018-10-14,62206969,Julie,He's an excellent communicator. I very highly recommend him!
11639446,337514972,2018-10-16,9055070,Kristin,"Adam is a wonderful host! His place is more like a guest house, with private rooms and a shared bath (and kitchen available). There is a cafe downstairs and he cooks wonderful, healthy meals. Highly recommended and I'd stay there again if I pass through Albany."
11639446,338809167,2018-10-20,74079287,Angelica,"Adam is a kind and gracious host.  Even though the building itself is on the older side, the inside is clean.  Off-street parking, good wifi, and free bottled water are available.  Delicious breakfast, meals-to-go if you wish.  Adam runs a café on the first floor and is willing to accommodate any special requests.   I would not hesitate to come back."
11639446,339614237,2018-10-21,221434330,Luke,"great service, food, and value. Good amenities, cleanliness, and location. it's a cafe IN Albany!"
11639446,340681219,2018-10-24,103490572,Aman,"I will not be the first or last to write an outstanding review about Adam and his Airbnb. I was in town for a speaking engagement and he gave me a ride to and from the event I was performing at, as well as the bus station the following morning. I was well feed with meals both in house and to-go. Adam is not the type of person who does anything for money, in fact, he wouldn’t even accept my full compensation for all the meals and rides he provided.<br/>I was only around for one night but I will remember Adam’s  hospitality for the rest of my life! I felt safe and taken care of, which is such a good feeling when traveling alone. <br/>As for the space, the room itself was perfect for my needs. It was clean and warm, and had everything I could need. The bathroom and communal spaces were also clean with all the necessary amenities, plus additional thoughtful touches.<br/>If everyone in the world were as kind and generous as Adam, it would be a much better place. I wish him and everyone who stays with him my very, very best."
11639446,341331508,2018-10-26,81952683,Ashley,Adam is a phenomenal host!
11639446,343455006,2018-10-31,17521655,Julie,"Just as what it described, it is an old building. Adam is a super host! I love the Turkish eggs and coffee he made for me every morning. It makes my feeling of away from home easier. The room has everything I need. It reminded me when I was living in a dorm room."
11639446,346705066,2018-11-09,2335838,Newton,Adam is a very caring host. Staying here means it'll be impossible to go hungry.
11639446,347649069,2018-11-11,5191069,John,"I have stayed in more than a dozen (maybe approaching a score) of airbnb's and this one is one of the two most FUN! (the other being one in the Shawangunks to the south) If you are an adventurer of this world, and looking to explore Albany and all it has to offer,  Adam's hostel (which it truly can be called) is a most excellent base for your adventures. Hospitality is truly Adam's passion!"
11639446,348070668,2018-11-12,51857181,Cynthia,"I enjoyed staying at Adam's Airbnb in Albany.  It was a quick drive to the sites, he greeted me on arrival and helped me out of the parking spot when I left.  Breakfast was simple and delicious.  Perhaps the corners, nooks, and crannies could be washed, but that didn't affect my stay."
11639446,354864648,2018-12-02,5191069,John,"I am a solar construction worker during the work week, but on weekends when i stay in Albany, Adam's hostel has become my go-to home. Everything is very comfortable and cozy, and the hospitality is special. Grateful for the breakfasts and lunch and friendliness."
11639446,355300369,2018-12-03,5191069,John,"And there Adam was, up making breakfast for me, even at 5:30 am! (since i had to go to work early Monday morning) Adam is so passionate and attentive to providing for his guests."
11639446,355961902,2018-12-06,98475046,Maddalena,"Adam is the absolute best, I’ve been here every time I’ve come through Albany and I could not recommend him more.<br/>Wonderful host but, above all, Adam is a wonderful human being."

11639446,618559675,2020-03-15,166691886,Oscar,Wow where do I begin!<br/>Adam treats you like family from the moment you check in. Adam was very flexible with the check in. He helped me with all my bags and offered to make me breakfast everyday for my stay. His eggs and Turkish Coffee was out of this world. The best thing about this booking is Adam he is kind respectful and caring. The bed was very soft and the room was very clean. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to rent here.
11639446,620251762,2020-03-21,65819978,Mim,Adam was very nice and flexible. His food was also yummy!

11639446,632274140,2020-06-26,12049006,Sean,Adam was a great host. He picked me up from the train station and he even did my laundry for me!

11639446,648291171,2020-08-08,35015599,Julian,"There are some reviews that Adam's hostel is unclean. It's not pristine, but I wouldn't say it's dirtier than a typical multi-bedroom apartment in an older building. It didn't smell or otherwise seem unhygienic. Location was not a fancy neighborhood but was very convenient to public transportation. The place has a laid-back vibe, and my room was very quiet and comfortable. I found it a very relaxing place to stay."
11639446,650993031,2020-08-14,9621449,Jenny,Adam is the best host you could ask for. I had an early schedule during my stay that changed at the end of the week and he was kind to accommodate me for breakfast when I told him it wasn't necessary.<br/>He really went out of the way. He even insisted on washing and folding all of my laundry so I wouldn't have to trek to and from the basement to the 2nd floor.<br/>Really kind and accommodating person. He really has a heart for people.
11639446,653856336,2020-08-20,32224780,Priscilla,"I think this is my third or fourth time staying here? It’s cheap if you need a place to crash. Don’t expect this place to have Beverly Hills vibes because it doesn’t. Adam is great and he’s very nice! Thank you Adam, I’ll be back again!!"
11639446,662398165,2020-09-09,67982781,Clay,I had a great time during my work trip!  Adam made sure that the place felt comfortable.

11639446,669392190,2020-09-29,51450292,Virginia,"Great organic, healthy breakfast and very close to Honest Weight food coop - an excellent health food market. This is a small hostel. Essential to wear flip flops for the shared shower/bathroom (bring your own or there's a pair available in the room). The host Adam is helpful, quickly responded to my Airbnb request for information, accommodated my late booking and offered interesting conversation when I asked his viewpoints on some topics."
11639446,670559541,2020-10-03,89863139,Jayanth,Really impressed with how Adam is maintaining this place as one man army

11639446,706414901,2020-11-03,373622689,Moulali,Great food and hospitality and worth the money.
11639446,709074101,2020-11-15,33649275,Anna,"This is essentially a hostel. It’s grimy. It smells like patchouli oil. The door of the bedroom had a gap down the entirety of the door that you could look through - worse than a stall in a women’s restroom. The host was very accommodating when I had to reschedule my visit because I had a migraine, but I accidentally rescheduled for the wrong day and again Adam was very accommodating and let me switch my reservation. However, when he greeted me at check-in he was not wearing a mask (even though in our prior communication I mentioned that I take Covid-19 safety protocols very seriously and mentioned masks and sanitizing etc.) and there were others staying there who were in the common areas not wearing masks either. I really didn’t want to stay there, but I thought to myself “it’s only one night” so I tried to fall asleep...it didn’t work. I felt very unsafe. I heard a woman shrieking and screaming. Followed by a door sounding like it was locked but someone was trying to push through it to open it. I decided to leave within an hour of laying down to try to sleep and decided to go to a hotel instead. I texted the host and explained that I didn’t feel safe and couldn’t stay and said that I locked all the doors behind me and put the key through the mail slot. He never responded to my message. I would never stay here again and I honestly don’t understand how he has so many great reviews. I’ve stayed in hostels all over the world and this is the worst one I’ve ever been to. Yes, it says it’s not a “Fancy clean house” but was I wrong to expect that it would at least be clean and sanitary ... in the middle of a pandemic no less? In the hour I spent in the room I ended up with bug bites and I was breaking out in hives... and my skin was completely covered by clothing."

Clean sandals and books are some of the thoughtful touches. Thanks for the great laundry service. Would give him 10 stars if I could.
11639446,762556825,2021-05-25,129172443,Jose,Adam was very accomodating. The room was clean and very comfortable.
11639446,762805580,2021-05-26,6992773,Au Yong,Adam is a super host for sure! Easy check-in and love the fact there’s a cafe right downstairs with Adam’s delicious and nutritious food. I was on a bike tour so it’s also extra useful to be able to buy pack lunch early in the morning to go with. Room is comfortable and had everything I needed. Will definitely return!
11639446,766578139,2021-06-05,129172443,Jose,Adams place is a great place to stay if you are on a budget.
11639446,768367815,2021-06-09,120300947,Sophie,"Adam was an amazing host. He stayed up late just so he could show me how to unlock the door, cooked a delicious breakfast with coffee, and offered to clean a spill that had come out of my suitcase. It was exactly what I needed for a night on the road."
11639446,770531592,2021-06-14,374691871,Chelsie,Adam was an amazing host!! We was very clear from the beginning on what to expect so that there were no surprises. He was also very helpful and provided an amazing breakfast! Definitely recommend booking with him!

11639446,410754644893703426,2021-07-20,4791198,Greig,"Staying at Adam’s place in Albany was very relaxing. I liked my room — especially the desk where I could write and collect my thoughts. The shared kitchen and bathrooms were easy to access. I liked the old feel of the building. And Adam served me a fresh, organic breakfast every morning. The best! Tip: Check out the gigantic wall maps in the café."

11639446,427426978635281998,2021-08-12,323833534,Susannah,"Keep in mind that this place is 40$, which compared to most places, is basically free. Adam is very good at communicating and quite accommodating. He met me outside, and can serve you your breakfast at any time you choose. Coffee was good!! Don’t have high expectations, and you will not be disappointed. The room was clean enough, though the sheets were not. Bathroom and shared spaces basically unusable. Still, Bring your own sheets, and this place is definitely worth a stay for those on a budget."
11639446,429596145625766991,2021-08-15,305336648,Ata,He was really helpful and kind

11639446,457910572643859795,2021-09-23,114416519,Kevin,"Staying at Adam's hostel was great. Adam was very hospitable. I loved looking forward to breakfast each morning. His description of the place is spot on. It's not the best neighborhood but it doesn't feel like it's dangerous, it's just not super affluent so the houses aren't nice and pretty, which is fine. The place is clean enough but it's not sparkly like a hotel. Also, fine by me. Overall, though, the value is incredible.<br/>About those breakfasts. The first day, for example, there was a peanut butter sandwich and some other kind of sandwich, maybe egg? Not totally sure. He also will make coffee for you if you ask."
11639446,459345723719375292,2021-09-25,157583081,Chloe,"Adam, the host, is the kindest & most generous person I have ever met in Albany. He patiently waited & picked me up at the bus terminal. There’s a cafe for in-house guests where he prepped meals for me. He even gave me complimentary snacks and a bracelet. He lives in the building so he literally one text/chat/call away in case you need anything. The five stars are all for him. On the otherhand, the place is as described. Set your expectations congruent to the details mentioned about the place & its price. I’d recommend it for people on a budget and are in the area for a short stay."
11639446,460106598180597333,2021-09-26,370819184,Zachary,Nice little spot for a quick overnight stay! Exactly as advertised. Great communication. <br/>Very friendly and accommodating host!

11639446,534774224015211900,2022-01-07,234746983,Yan,Adam was real honest in the description. I had a nice stay and Adam was really responsive. The fact that he made me a vegan sandwich for the road was very thoughtful!

Adam, foi muito prestativo em tudo que ele precisou, e generoso em busca-lo na rodoviária ele gostou muito de sua estadia. Espero que quando ele for em ALBANNY novamente possa se hospedar na residência de Adam."

Adam is a very kind and friendly host and he described very well the place and location before letting you book it. <br/>The bedroom was clean and organized however the bathroom and external rooms not so much.<br/>The neighborhood doesn't look very safe but I didn't have any trouble at all. Parked my car on the street in front of the place, no problem."

11639446,947811644377126128,2023-07-31,525881784,Adrian,"I hate to give a bad rating for such a wonderful man, because Adam is a great person and a good cook but he is not an attentive landlord. The entrance smelled like wet dogs, the main living area smelled moldy and gross and there was clearly a tenant smoking cigarettes in his room but when I asked, Adam claimed the tenant just had cigarette smoke on his clothes. There is no way it was just ""on his clothes"". The whole floor reeked of cigarettes. The kitchen was frankly disturbing. There were moldy holes in the ceiling above the stove, the stove tops had weird black crusted bits of food piled in them and needed a deep cleaning. All the dishes needed a serious cleaning and had grease and food particles dried to them. The only pluses were the free breakfasts were edible, Adam is kind-hearted, and the shower is hot. But the whole main living quarters desparately needs cleaning and at night the neighbor turns his boombox up extremely loud every night and plays window-shaking hiphop to 12."
11639446,957281041063317613,2023-08-13,93439768,Mahathi,"Booked this listing on behalf of my cousin.<br/>Adam helped with the commute from the bus stop to the airbnb location, which was a big help!<br/>Heard that the room was very neat and the food provided was delish.<br/>The place seems walkable to nearby stores and was safe.<br/>Adam was very patient with our reservation changing several times as the checkout date was being extended. He was very proactive and instantly responded to any questions we had.<br/>Overall, a pleasant stay for anybody looking to stay within a budget and comes with a sweet host :)"

11639446,1007281884467523039,2023-10-21,17224232,Alva,"Adam’s place was the perfect place for me. It’s the hostel that I don’t think I knew existed in Albany having not only grown up in the city, but also as an experienced international traveler who regularly chooses to stay in hostels while traveling on a budget. I’m a self-sufficient traveler and Airbnb super host myself. Adam communicates very respectfully and clearly. Breakfast was delicious. Glad he was able do a load of laundry. If I’m in town again I’ll check to see what’s available again."
11639446,1007988460646296969,2023-10-22,202988225,Kevin,A great room for a fair price.
11639446,1012415131320924362,2023-10-28,155937663,Luther,"I was in Albany for a statewide advocacy conference. Out of all of the Airbnb locations I have stayed in between Albany, Schenectady, and Troy, Adam's place was above-and-beyond. He was very helpful and caring, and he is absolutely prompt on his responses and his checking-in on everything from the first day to the check-out time. As an added bonus, he delivered more than just breakfast two days in a row. The meals he brought to me on both mornings were so amazing and plentiful (couldn't even eat all of it during my stay due to so much food at the conference), I even bought the leftover food he made home with me that I could even eat while I am at work back in my hometown. For such a very low price, the location, and for everything, this is certainly a place I would recommend anyone when visiting New York's capital region or surrounding areas.  Looking forward to reserving his place again if needed. Thanks, Adam, for everything."
11639446,1047955278317638925,2023-12-16,17224232,Alva,"I have stayed here before. The room is safe, warm and cozy. Adam is a great communicator. I’m an independent traveler who has been to over 30 foreign countries. Adam’s place suits my needs well. Breakfast and laundry are on the house. I’m glad I found this place."
11639446,1048631506595322123,2023-12-17,17224232,Alva,Thumbs up
11639446,1089243417789057610,2024-02-11,327755718,Justus,Exactly as described. I would recommend staying here if you mostly need somewhere to hold your things and lay your head at night. Great for a one night stay.
11639446,1102302951637451818,2024-02-29,74269948,Louis,"DO NOT GO THERE<br/>I am going to be totally honest here: Adam was very welcoming (I am not going to deny that). BUT Adam shall not be allowed to host anyone at his place! Adam house is insalubrious and present a real HEALTH HAZARD!!! When I booked a night over Adam sent me a message recalling among other things that his place did not have AC and that the bathroom and Kitchen were « dirty ». Because of his message I thought Adam was acting in good faith. I double checked the pics and found out that his place was looking maybe a bit dusty but not DIRTY. But here is the real reason why Adam sent me  this message: as soon as I contacted airbnb to get a partial refund or to (at least) make sure that no one else will ever sleep in such hazardous place, Airbnb told me: Sorry you agreed to the flat « condition » so we can’t do anything to help you! I never agreed the flat condition as the pics do not reflect the reality (even a dog would not sleep there). SHAME ON YOU AIRBNB!<br/>Stay safe, stay away"
12284708,75922899,2016-05-23,72078528,Mareen,"My trip to Albany was an overall success! Nick and Liz were super nice and made my stay very comfortable. My weekend was packed full with studying and nursing examinations; however, I was able to relax during breaks in their cozy home and environment. I also enjoyed their backyard and the fire pit very much. I was also able to walk everywhere, which saved me from renting a car. Nick and Liz were super nice, welcoming and even provided transportation during my stay. Thank you again guys"

12284708,79519051,2016-06-13,61216450,Larry,I was on a cross country motorcycle trip and took a day off in Albany. Nicolas place is in a great location within walking distance to lots of food and pubs. The room was as described and clean and everything I needed was laid out for me. The house overall had a nice 'vibe' and I enjoyed my stay. I did not get to meet Nicolas but briefly met roommates who were very nice. I would stay here again.
12284708,81406365,2016-06-22,35344934,Damek,Neighborhood is centrally located. Hosts are great. They have an awesome little puppy too!

Nic basically made a lot of modifications to the house and they even had a rooftop area for you to enjoy the night view.
<br/>The place was neat and clean, close to food areas and there was no hassle in the checking in and out process. They have a friendly dog too!
<br/>Will definitely stay at this place if we are in the area again. :)"

12284708,84647569,2016-07-08,55518081,Lina,"Nicolas was very helpful, kind, and flexible. The room was clean, and he answered all questions on a timely manner. The only thing that could have made the stay better would have been air conditioning. The room is in the top floor and was really hot."
12284708,86013467,2016-07-14,81332720,Marilyn,"The listing was accurate. They were very welcoming and friendly, easy to get along with, willing to accommodate. My husband was around more than I, since I was working most of the time. My husband said they are pretty cool people. The neighborhood wasn't bad, it was close to a lot of things."
12284708,86875866,2016-07-17,83756973,Simone,"I came up to Albany for a weekend to visit my boyfriend and have a place of my own to stay since he had lots of people at his place. Nic and Liz were absolutely wonderful! I only got to interact with Nic when I first arrived but he was warm and inviting and let me settle in on my own. I had the pleasure of talking to Liz for a while one morning and she was great--very friendly, and open and willing to talk to about anything. They have a cute puppy named Bella who wants nothing more than to be your friend. Overall I greatly enjoyed my stay. The room was clean and comfortable and very cute and I would recommend anyone coming to albany to stay with Nic and Liz!! "
12284708,89436979,2016-07-28,77487154,Andreas,"Great place, very nice hosts! The room was very comfortable and clean and hosts were welcoming and friendly. Neighborhood is centrally located with a lot to do in the area, and accessible by public transit. Although I only had a short stay this seems like a very nice place for a longer one!! "
12284708,91093295,2016-08-03,52763601,Jordi,"The room was as described, with air conditioning, tv, bathroom, access to the kitchen and fridge... And not far from the city centre. Also the neighbourhood was quiet.<br/>And they were all very friendly and kind. It's a good option to stay with them if someone has to go to Albany."
12284708,92147515,2016-08-07,14483061,Tomasz,Wonderful experience. Simple room with air conditioning wifi and tv. It was very clean. The hosts were very friendly and going out of the way to tell me about the region. The location is very good within walking distance to the college of St. Rose and only a little way away from the bars and restaurants further downtown.
12284708,94370286,2016-08-15,69622608,Luisa,Our stay in Albany was awesome .Nic and Liz are very welcoming and super friendly. They gave us great advice what to do in Albany.you'll also find a book in your room which gives your recommendations of what to do and how to get there. It felt like home and we are very glad for the nice time.
12284708,95646006,2016-08-20,82425823,Jiyong,Rick and Liz are very friendly persons! I have felt like staying at home
12284708,96600550,2016-08-23,11851191,Kevin,"The ""Red Shed"" was great!  It was located only a small walk from some of the best night life in Albany and the place is extremely welcoming.  Nick and Liz are the perfect hosts for those that want to travel and explore or just stay in, full of suggestions and tips either way!  Had a fun time, will totally stay again if in the area."
12284708,97244940,2016-08-26,87378556,Narcissa,"Our stay was great, location was amazing, and the room was lovely. Nic & Liz are attentive hosts. "

12284708,99725831,2016-09-05,36751921,Utsav,"Although we didn't get to meet Nicolas, we did get to meet his wonderful wife and his adorable dog. We really enjoyed our stay here, as everything was as advertised. Nicolas's wife, Liz, made some small talk to us and helped us feel at home, and even introduced us to their dog Bella, who we thought was just so awesome! A very happy pup! Overall, we would stay here again as the location was really convenient, and the airBnB itself was really clean. Getting in and out of their apartment was a breeze, and if we find ourselves in Albany again, this will probably be t he first place we would want to stay. "
12284708,105332282,2016-10-01,67370438,Sukriye,We felt very welcomed and at home. Nick and Liz (and Bella

12284708,111961246,2016-11-02,71025426,Irina,"Nick and Liz are fantastic! This is my second time staying with them, and I enjoyed my stay just as much as the first time."
12284708,113080194,2016-11-10,71025426,Irina,"This is my third time at Nick's and Liz's. I need to travel to Albany for work very often, and their place is close to the bus stop, downtown as well as to Suny. They are extremely welcoming and responsive to the guests' needs, which makes their place one of my favorite housing options when in town. You won't regret staying with them."
12284708,113680751,2016-11-13,7992282,Alexandra,"Nick and Liz truly believe in giving you the full Airbnb experience. Their dog, Bella, is the most wonderful pup you'll ever meet. The bed is comfy and the house's vibe is so welcoming. I definitely recommend that you consider them for your visit to Albany :D"
12284708,114251451,2016-11-16,71025426,Irina,"As always, I have enjoyed very much my stay with Liz and Nick! "

12284708,120313609,2016-12-09,105588732,Michael,This bnb was awesome! The room was so nice. The other guests and Nick and Liz were very friendly and welcoming! Definitely would stay again and recommend to others! Just be careful with the street parking signs; the parking police are very strict!
12284708,122459289,2016-12-23,64774013,Tobias,We enjoyed our stay with Nick and Liz and their dog Bella. Everything was as described and both Nick and Liz were very helpful and made us feel very welcome. The house was very neat and clean and we would definitely stay at their place again. 
12284708,124278510,2017-01-01,101828224,Kyle,Like always a great stay with Nick and Liz! Really nice people with awesome rooms. Comfy beds. 
12284708,151145914,2017-05-11,84353180,Judith,"great place, close to downtown, which was important for my son, he actually could walk to his workplace in less than 30 min. two thumbs up for the host, who was and still is very helpful, since my sons internship got extended<br/>"
12284708,152673160,2017-05-17,109262238,Lili,"It was a clean, organized room as expected. The mini fridge was a very nice addition. Parking was not an issue for me, easy street parking. This place has everything you need PLUS Bella, super adorable and playful dog that enjoys sneaking up to your bed!"
12284708,153533931,2017-05-21,4909832,Caroline,"The host seemed very nice. The place overall has a great value but there were a few issues. The listing does not indicate that there are a total of four bedroom (with a possibility of a total of 8 people) for a single bathroom home.<br/>The house, especially the bathroom and kitchen, needs to be cleaned on a regular basis which was not done once during our 4 day stay. The staircase has a very strong urine smell which during a hot day because very overwhelming. <br/>The host did not make an effort to greed us at all nor talk to us or check on us during our stay. <br/>Nick was still a very helpful host when I emailed him my questions. Upon arrival we requested that the AC be installed which was done promptly. "
12284708,154457987,2017-05-24,3967221,Moises,Simple place. 
12284708,156148172,2017-05-29,118259397,Jenn,"We came to the Red Shed for a nearby wedding. It was very welcoming, and Nick was great about replying to any questions we had. We also loved spending time with their dog Bella. Thanks again for a great stay!"
12284708,164779929,2017-06-29,84004934,Danxu,"The room is clean and cozy, it's very comfortable and our host is so nice and kind, I will recommend this to my friend."
12284708,175703442,2017-07-29,118701184,Elizabeth,"I stayed at Nick's for two months. The house is in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Albany and very close to the college of Saint Rose. The neighborhood may seem dodgy in some areas, but I generally felt safe walking alone to and from downtown everyday (25-30min walk, faster by bus).<br/>When I first arrived at the house, I was disappointed to find that my room hadn't been swept in quite a while, and there were dishes in the sink from the last AirBnB'er. I was disappointed to find the fridge had many containers of moldy food that needed to be thrown out awhile ago. I don't expect the place I stay to be spotless, but a bit more attention to detail would have made my initial impression more positive. I brought these issue up to Nick, and he assured me that the housekeeper was scheduled to come soon (and she did).<br/>Nick was very responsive to messages, and had no problem helping me or the others guests with any issues that came up during our stay. A couple of times the power went out in the kitchen, and Nick was quick to fix it.  "
12284708,177068635,2017-08-01,107714839,William,A very nice place to stay
12284708,177675764,2017-08-03,35676368,Kaitlin,I had a great stay! Self check in was easy and the room was clean and beautiful. Convenient location-- I was able to walk everywhere I needed.
12284708,179506122,2017-08-07,91004569,Katie,"I travel to the Albany area for work and need lodging about half the week. Nick's place was perfect for this. Very cozy and welcoming. The room was bright and comfortable, I didn't use it but there is also a mini fridge. I appreciated that they provide towels, one less thing to pack. I arrived on a super hot day and the AC was up and running, which made a huge difference. It was also nice that everything in the house is labeled so there's no searching for things you need. I will definitely be back."
12284708,183937623,2017-08-18,6717565,Hannah,"Good location, very friendly host. The pizza shop on the corner makes the best deli sandwiches ever!"
12284708,185798762,2017-08-22,134638264,April,"When I saw this ad I thought I'd be renting a room from a sweet couple with a cute dog. But in reality the couple and the dog don't live here (never met them, only me texting them that I arrived) This like a dorm for 4 Airbnb rooms. There is also only 1 bathroom for all those rooms. <br/>The other Airbnb renters seem to be there longer term (due to the local medical center) so there is the fact that they do lots of meal prep for their weeks and the kitchen and space in the fridge is pretty much a free for all.<br/>Frankly if I knew  this I wouldn't have rented this room. I feel a bit duped. <br/>On a positive note the house is mostly quiet, clean and the room is just cute as the pics.small. And the location is great for walking pretty much anywhere in Albany. <br/>So if sharing with a bunch of other renters is no biggie for you, have at it. If not, keep looking."
12284708,187248112,2017-08-26,136630813,Jael,Nicholas' place is a good base both if you are heading out of the city by car or explore downtown Albany by foot. We were very comfortable there.
12284708,196568130,2017-09-23,79523869,Daniel,"Great Location,  near Downtown and all the Action.   Parking a little tricky but available.  Nice room excellent value for money."
12284708,197721484,2017-09-26,95460541,Brandon,"For the price, I truly can't complain THAT much. This place is affordable and in a decent location. Still, a few things were disappointing. For one, my room was a mess when I first arrived. Apparently, Nicholas forgot I was staying there and he was out eating food, so I had to take the used bed sheets off, and replace them with clean ones. The worst part is that on the last night, while I was trying to sleep I found two bed bugs crawling on my sheets. Personally, I would rather pay more for a better experience next time I'm in Albany. All that being said, Nick was nice and the dogs were very friendly. It was also pretty quiet and located close to food places!"
12284708,198463124,2017-09-29,6962990,Mike,I had a nice stay and slept great at Nicholas's place.  Was able to make breakfast in the morning and was a very comfortable spot.
12284708,201572899,2017-10-08,125249186,Robert,"Great place, great people and a totally great deal."
12284708,206075066,2017-10-23,16087219,Ann & Dennis,"Location is pretty central, walkable (35 or so min) to downtown good shops on immediate area, but some restaurants."
12284708,227040303,2018-01-13,77989141,Corrie,The place was ok.  The best part about this place was the bbq joint across the street.  There's no off street parking so several times I ended up parking a block away.  And no shovels to shovel the sidewalk or front steps.... or your car out.  That was kind of annoying because no one else shoveled the stairs or sidewalk either.  So we all just walked through the snow.  Only one bathroom and at one point 5 of us were staying there.... so twice I ran to a store to go to the bathroom.  The mini fridge was a nice bonus.  I ended up getting a space heater for my room when the temps dropped in the teens only because the wind whipped through those old windows.  The kitchen was nice and the laundry area was handy.  I was there for 2 months.  I think this would be a better place for a shorter time
12284708,229999686,2018-01-26,144445841,Mary Ann,Comfortable place in great location.
12284708,239413766,2018-03-01,52272847,Gabriel,Location is about 15 min by public bus (frequency about every 20 min) to downtown or 30-40 min walk. It's located in the suburbs.<br/>Check in was smooth with a combination lock on the door although I didn't get to meet Nicholas.<br/>They had a nice folder of necessary information and the room was tidy and clean. It's three rooms upstairs for guests and they live downstairs. The bathroom is also downstairs. The bed mattress quality was a bit soft for my taste but they had a smart tv and excellent wifi. Nicholas was also gracious in allowing me to use the washing machine so I was very grateful doe that.
12284708,252437992,2018-04-10,179259656,Tracy,"Great place to stay! Very clean, felt safe and comfortable. Loved the welcome binder on my bed when I got there."
12284708,473377909,2019-06-21,242162948,Nick,Great place to stay to work in the Capitol!
12284708,478261723,2019-06-29,31218466,Del,Chads place is in a great location for checking out Albany. I could walk to a lot of the restaurants that I ate at. I could drive everything else within pretty much 15 minutes.
12284708,504988361,2019-08-08,191878130,Raul,"Chad es un muy buen anfitrión, atento y responde rápidamente ante cualquier requerimiento. Las casa esta bien ubicada (bus 114 y 763 a dos bloques) y cuenta con varios locales de comida rápida y un market a 4 bloques. El barrio se ve algo complejo, pero es tranquilo. La pieza es cómoda, cuenta con A/C y televisión.  Recomiendo totalmente a Chad."
12284708,516646173,2019-08-24,13268587,Mikhail,Great place to stay! Everything as described. The host is very welcoming. A lot of nice food places nearby.
12284708,528708797,2019-09-13,147796990,Ashley,Staying at Chad’s place was pretty cool . I was pretty close to restaurants and stores . Chad was awesome with the communication and he made sure to have everything that was needed .
12284708,554576017,2019-10-26,218946060,Poojitha,good.
12799126,655543080,2020-08-23,218838308,Chy'An,"Host was very kind, very responsive. The pictures are accurate. Good location, bars and restaurants in walking distance. I didn’t have a hard time finding parking. Had a Flexible check-in and check-out time."

12799126,702114530,2020-10-19,33948449,Lola,Musab is so nice and helpful! He drove me to the store when I needed a ride. The Listing is true to description and pictures. A Great location for stay if you enjoy exploring downtown Albany.
12799126,710917611,2020-11-23,364080830,Joshua,Nice location.
12799126,713006886,2020-12-02,344441907,Mohammad,It was a great experience with the host. Amazing hospitality and great place to commute all areas of the city. I'll stay again.
12799126,720028013,2020-12-31,247872765,Jason,"Musab’s place was excellent and I had a comfortable stay, I would definitely come back again."
12799126,721591535,2021-01-03,130048619,Jenny,"I had an amazing stay with Musab, Hasan, and their roommate Mesut. They were beyond hospitable and super fun to hang out with. The location cannot be beat: the apartment is right above a pizza shop that closes at 3AM, and right off of Lark, where you'll find cuisines of all kinds and cute little shops. It's also within walking distance of the historical doors of Albany and other landmark buildings. During my stay, I got to meet their mischievous and playful black kitten that has since stolen a piece of my heart. This will be my go-to anytime I find myself in Albany. These guys have made my time in Albany unforgettable. I'm grateful to have stayed with them."
12799126,732877536,2021-02-20,152712221,Tyra,"I stayed at Musab's place for seven weeks while completing a clinical rotation at Albany Medical Center. I chose this place because it was a quick walk to the hospital (around 10 minutes). The place had a great location with it being in the heart of downtown Albany. There is a market nearby which made weekly grocery trips extremely easy. The hosts were super sweet and Musab even drove me to the airport to catch my flight home. There is a kitten and it is very sweet! I would definitely recommend this place as a long term or short term stay. <br/>Pros: <br/>Close to AMC<br/>Located Downtown <br/>Hosts were very friendly <br/>Cons: <br/>The street gets extremely noisy<br/>The place felt a little crowded with four people living in it. I believe one guest was only temporarily visiting, so this shouldn't be an issue in the future."
12799126,755056706,2021-05-04,393998577,Y,Had a great stay! Musab is a great host!
12799126,756676630,2021-05-09,393998577,Y,Musab is an amazing host!
12799126,418765088908280133,2021-07-31,173279573,Talya,"I stayed here for two months, the location can’t beat be beat. Musab and Hassan and great hosts. I felt at home. The kitchen isn’t great, but it’s good enough to cook in. I don’t know how clean it was though. Anyways, I didn’t mind. Great value overall."
12799126,422371200336162913,2021-08-05,415791516,Hitesh Rao,Musab and Hassan were amazing hosts. It was my first experience with Airbnb and I am happy I made a booking at their place. They were very friendly and helped me out with my transport too. I would recommend anyone visiting Albany to stay at their place.
12799126,425282066898049387,2021-08-09,115051953,Thomas,"Very nice host<br/>And the apartment is very well located, everything is ona walking distance friendly!"

12799126,516618801267489022,2021-12-13,214008872,Ashley Anne,"the location is great as it is accessible to many establishments - like restaurants, and mode of transportation <br/>the apartment itself though very old has been maintained by the hosts - it is actually clean<br/>the hosts were accomodating to the needs<br/>the only downside is that it is very noisy but that is given since the place is located by one of the major intersections, so youll hear cars passing by."
12799126,523936895481813499,2021-12-23,214008872,Ashley Anne,"great host, very accomodating and approachable"

12799126,769549292454769424,2022-11-27,366458550,Brittany,"Musab is an excellent host. He is kind a respectful, and goes above and beyond. I stayed for 3 months during my travel contract, and I was so happy to have a clean, safe spot so close to the hospital. I would recommend him to anyone!"
12799126,849332370281574007,2023-03-17,128316566,Ramakrishna,Musab is an excellent host. He goes out of his way to help you anyway he can. <br/>Best location you can ask for . Mediterranean pickup place right next door and lot of other places in walkable distance. <br/>I was moving to Albany for work and this place was walkable to my workplace.

12799126,981893850075367520,2023-09-16,72867609,Elizabeth,"I recommend this airbnb to anyone visiting Albany! I stayed for four weeks and I would come back any time. I felt right at home immediately. Musab and I were messaging about how I was driving from another state and would arrive late, and not only was he kind and understanding about the whole thing, but he actually met me outside his building and carried my suitcase upstairs. The room was cozy and clean. The bed was super comfortable and I liked how the sun came through the window in the morning. Musab also kept the bathroom and kitchen really clean. He even shared some delicious food he cooked. I should end on the best part, though: his cat is so beautiful and so friendly. I'm afraid I don't know how to spell his name, but I loved him very much and will miss him."
12799126,1085620278696047753,2024-02-06,2906887,Christian,"musab is a nice guy, but apartment is very old, poorly maintained and generally run-down (pealing paint, bathroom tiles broken, furniture run down), and while counters, floors and bath tub/sink were kept clean, the whole place is in desperate need of a deep clean. Also, the room faces a busy street and a bus stop that are VERY noisy (and I'm a long-time Brooklyn resident who's not sensitive to noise). Overall, the lousiest Airbnb of the many I've rented (including in developing countries). This place shouldn't be on Airbnb without significant improvements. I ended up spending most nights with friends I have nearby instead of at Musab's."
13083497,83160297,2016-07-01,31825529,Pam,"A very clean spacious house with everything needed. Comfortable beds, and a bathroom on each floor.  Very nice layout. We traveled with my husband's mother, and it was great to have a bedroom on the ground level so she didn't have to walk upstairs. Close to major roads and yet a quiet neighborhood & private setting- great to sit on deck and listen to the birds. <br/>Chris was easy to contact & we had no problems.  We extended our stay & will be coming back again- a good bargain when traveling with multiple adults "
13083497,83447612,2016-07-03,31825529,Pam,"We were happy to return to this clean, comfortable & quiet location just off of Western Ave in Albany NY.    Highly recommended!"
13083497,87128135,2016-07-18,19410564,Sabarni,Akhilesh helped host my friends from out of town. He was very helpful with answering my questions during the reservation. He was also very accommodating with our late night arrival. The house is beautiful and kept spotlessly clean with a beautiful deck. A lower level bathroom and bedroom makes it ideal for folks with mobility challenges. Everything one needed was available and the house was centrally located though it is a nice wooded neighborhood. Will certainly recommend this place to others!
13083497,88618480,2016-07-25,61138897,Renee," Had a lovely stay, house was awesome. Felt safe and secure.  The house was clean, spacious, functional, and nicely decorated. Also, Akhilesh was a terrific host! Although we did not meet in person, Akhilesh was always an email or text away, and made sure that all our questions were answered and solved. We were so happy to stay here during our weekend, and would not hesitate to stay here again when we are back! Thanks Akhilesh!"
13083497,89580521,2016-07-29,66898032,Elizabeth,"I rented Chris' home while I was in Albany taking the bar. The home is spacious, clean, and in a lovely neighborhood. It's a very peaceful, relaxing place--great patio in the back overlooking the woods! The location is also convenient to 90/787, and it only takes about 15 minutes to drive into the city. Chris was very helpful and responsive during my stay, and eager to make sure that I had a good experience. I would certainly recommend Chris' home for future guests."
13083497,90324580,2016-07-31,82024781,Wendy,"The house itself comfortably accommodated our group of eight. We adults were pleased with the large gathering space, and the teenagers enjoyed exploring the overgrown path down to the banks of the creek.   The only facilities issue other guests should be aware of is that the downstairs shower is very very small, which would present a big problem to many folks. 
<br/>Chris, our host, was very
<br/>communicative during our inquiries about the house and all through our stay. In fact, this became the big negative about the rental. There are cameras at at least two locations outside, and a sensor on the door which notifies him instantly of all comings and goings. When I asked Chris about this during the welcome conversation he said it was for our security, but our lack of privacy became soberingly apparent when I received a call the next morning less than a minute after parking with instructions to move the car.  We all spent the weekend very much aware of the scrutiny, and we couldn't help but vaguely wonder whether any cameras aimed inside.   "
13083497,92411898,2016-08-08,4448274,Carolee,"We had a lovely stay at the Pristine Cape Cod, tremendously enjoying the deck overlooking the trees, the spaciousness of the accommodations, and the super convenient location. We recommend this place for anyone looking for a great getaway in the middle of everything. We also enjoyed exploring the nearby restaurants Fiorello's, Barcelona, and City Line, which we thought were all wonderful. "
13083497,96089318,2016-08-21,83583280,Lee,"This was a great experience - the house was exactly as represented in the listing, and it was super clean and comfortable.  We had a great weekend in Albany!"

13083497,124773531,2017-01-02,55129656,Faresh,"Lovely cosy place to stay. Perfect for families.  We moved a few ornaments out the way to avoid breakage, but not dramas overall. Host was very responsive on chat and check in was pretty seamless. Would recommend this place to all. "
13083497,127190597,2017-01-16,50402281,Julie,"An awesome space. We had our family together for the first time in over 5 years. There was room for everyone, the kids room was a HUGE bonus. Everything was sparkling clean and the kitchen had everything we needed and more!"
13083497,129185877,2017-01-29,15099566,Rebecca,Perfect place to spend a weekend in Albany with small children.  Highly recommend it!
13083497,138311629,2017-03-19,108995827,Lois,"Our family came into town from all over the country to attend our daughters wedding.  This house I recommend. Its large and comfortable, although  very much outdated in its furnishings, it works!  We stayed in March but saw the potential for summer. we would have loved to utilize the property more.  "
13083497,145296567,2017-04-17,125432871,Sushil,Excellent location and very spacious house
13083497,148324058,2017-04-30,25396041,April,Host very responsiveness. The place is tucked away in a private corner of the neighborhood but at the same time convenient to everything. Lots of space and nice deck to hangout on. 
13083497,151917349,2017-05-14,47541168,Liz,It was clean and pleasant.  Was perfect for multiple family members in town for my son's graduation.
13083497,154650481,2017-05-25,88549901,Josh,"Chris' home is in a perfect location! 4 miles to the Capital, which is the whole reason our team was there. Clean, private, quiet, and a feel at home vibe. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend! "
13083497,156100614,2017-05-29,79150002,Corey,"Excellent house that is well-labeled with instructions, stocked with extra food and kitchen utensils, and extremely spacious. The downsides were that both toilets easily clogged and nether one of the showers were optimal. Regardless, we would rent here again. "
13083497,160052408,2017-06-12,77187051,Charley,"This home was in a very nice, quiet neighborhood, and the location was beautiful! It was only a few miles from UAlbany as well as many stores. A few things to be aware of: if you plan to do extensive laundry, you'll need to go to a laundromat down the road. You will be asked to do a few basic cleaning things before checkout. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this location again. It was an awesome experience, and my husband and I were very pleased with the place!"
13083497,163420336,2017-06-24,121932982,Matthias,"Decent place to stay if you need to rent a whole house in Albany area. Sits in a good location in a safe neighborhood. Very well kept, with most amenities you would expect from a house.<br/>We felt that there were SO many rules posted in so many different places throughout the entire house that it put us a little bit on edge. It felt like everything we did had to be checked against 4 different rule sheets to make sure it was acceptable.<br/>One of the rules we noticed was that no additional guests were allowed on the property. The listing states that the property is ""suitable for events"", so we had planned a small family cookout for our stay where we would have the house guests plus 7-8 additional guests. After seeing the rule posted we figured we better double check with the host. But we were told that a cookout of this size would not be allowed on the property so we had to change our plans last minute, despite the house being listed as suitable for events."
13083497,166468326,2017-07-03,95107825,Bikrant Kumar,We had a great time. Hope we will plan again.
13083497,167707314,2017-07-07,5366956,Rob,"This cottage is ideally located near Western Avenue yet in a spot that feels remote and peaceful.  We were fortunate to rent the whole house, and it was much larger than we expected, with four spacious bedrooms, one downstairs and three upstairs (plus a dormer which we had no use for).  The living and dining rooms were also very spacious and well appointed.  The hosts were communicative and gave clear instructions for entering the house and caring for it during and at the end of our stay.  They were also kind enough to stock the house with a range of staples including cereals, coffee, and snacks.  We couldn't have asked for a better situation during our few days in the Albany area."
13083497,179068388,2017-08-06,72186594,Joyce,Clean house with spacious bedrooms.
13083497,179831203,2017-08-08,58114766,Martha,"Akhilesh is very responsive to communication.  The WiFi is good, but the cable TV only includes the starter package, so nothing other than local stations. The TV in the living room is a big LED and we could have used our chromecast if we had wanted to watch something else. One bedroom had an older tube TV, but I don't think anyone tried to use it.  There were plenty of clean towels, etc.  There were lots of basic kitchen items provided including coffee, tea, creamers, cereal, etc."
13083497,187718109,2017-08-27,30807924,Gaen,The house was everything is claimed to be.  It was clean with plenty of room for our family. The location was perfect for our family event. Our host was very responsive to any communication.  Thank you.
13083497,195220754,2017-09-18,126296360,Kim,"Wonderful place, very convenient to everything, very clean and plenty of room!"
13083497,202304211,2017-10-10,21570223,Ariana,"House is very clean and neighborhood pleasant.  Lots of amenities, but we had technical trouble with the WiFi, printer, dishwasher, toaster, and a few plugs.  Thankfully, the host is very responsive."
13083497,203786075,2017-10-15,57501821,Patrice,"Place was nice, clean! Comfy beds! Nice view"
13083497,205611785,2017-10-22,32829495,Nora,"Chris's place was perfect for our group. We were in town for a wedding and everything about staying at his place was easy- booking, communication, check-in, check out. Don't be fooled by the unassuming 'cute little place' look, it's HUGE. We had a full house but there was still plenty of space. We spent mornings and evenings out on the deck, two full bathrooms kept us from getting stressed out when it was time to get ready, and nice big comfy furniture in the living room when it was time to relax. Everything we needed was there and accessible- extra blankets, pillows, towels. Lots of extras in the kitchen-bottled water, cereal, coffee, tea. It was a no fuss, super-convenient, and affordable way for our whole family (my husband and I, our 4 adult children and a couple of spouses) to stay together but still have enough space and privacy for all. And it was all SO CLEAN.  Thanks Chris for such a nice stay!"
13083497,208688801,2017-11-02,96728277,Marian,"We came to town for our daughter's Halloween wedding and stayed 4 nights at Akhilesh's place. We were 6 -- my husband and I, our son and his wife, and their 2 little girls, 3 and 20 months. It was very clean and organized, we found everything we needed. I particularly have to recommend this home if you are traveling with children. There is a toddler bed and a playroom, which our granddaughters especially enjoyed. The neighborhood is great, and the location is convenient to I87. Akhilesh accommodated our slightly early arrival, which we appreciated."
13083497,214287303,2017-11-25,129472128,Elaine,Chose this house because our family was visiting our 97 year old mom at Beverwyck Independent Living Residence - 2 miles away. Perfectly comfortable for my husband and I and three adult kids who each had separate bedrooms with queen beds. There is s toddler and infant room to w/toys. Clean and comfortable with large TV in living room. Close by places to get food too.
13083497,223687442,2018-01-01,162946271,Dawn,"We enjoyed this large, comfortable, and tastefully decorated home for a low-key New Year's get together for two families with 3 school-aged kids between us. The house is much bigger inside than it appears from the front; there are four bedrooms with large beds plus an extra room with children's toys and games. The bathrooms are large, clean, and well-equipped. We all fit around the dining room table and had plenty of room to play board games together in the living room. The kitchen has a decent selection of equipment and basic supplies that we used to make breakfast and dinner for ourselves during our stay. We know the area well and didn't need recommendations for what to do around town, but for those not familiar with the Capital Region there are plenty of regional guides to give you ideas for activities. The house was immaculate. We appreciated the easy and streamlined check-out instructions."
13083497,228957278,2018-01-21,4003568,Karen,"Very clean, comfortable place to stay, very easy to get around even in the snow. (With a car)Hosts were really attentive and we had one small issue of a blown fuse and it was dealt with very quickly. I would highly recommend the House as a great place for a large family to stay very comfortably"

13083497,245813399,2018-03-23,3220221,Azuka,Akhilesh was very helpful and quick to respond to any messages.
13083497,246886805,2018-03-26,76857392,Howard,The house was very nice and very clean.  Perfect for kids and ideally located for the Capital District.  Chris was a great host.
13083497,249006338,2018-04-01,167919741,Danielle,"Our party of seven (5 adults, 2 little ones) had a great weekend at this spot. The home is spacious and everything was nice and clean when we arrived. There were some nice amenities, including plenty of towels -- and the kitchen was stocked with basics for our use like coffee, tea, cream and sugar.<br/>We happened to get lucky with the weather which allowed us to take advantage of the deck with creek view, which was a welcome respite from what's been a tough winter.<br/>The bedrooms were all comfortable and nicely appointed with classic furnishings. <br/>The home is also in a great location, right in the middle of Albany and easily accessible to just about anything in the city.<br/>We'd definitely stay here again next time we take the whole clan to Albany."
13083497,251801299,2018-04-08,181705429,Syed,House was very clean and spacious. Rooms are big and it is a very comfortable place

13083497,264241282,2018-05-13,24795346,Steve,"Nice place, quiet neighborhood. They are very responsive to questions."
13083497,270153993,2018-05-28,76781760,J.P.,"Chris was quite responsive and accommodating for our stay. My brother in law got married just outside of Albany this past weekend, and my family stayed at Chris’ house for the weekend. The place is spacious and comfortable. We hosted a breakfast for the groomsmen and had plenty of room for all the guys to get dressed. The grounds were the perfect back drop for pictures as we got ready as well. It was much more convenient and affordable then getting multiple hotel rooms for the weekend. As for the notes around the house that were mentioned in some of the reviews, they were no bother to us. We quickly realized that Chris rents out individual rooms as well as renting out the whole house. It was obvious that those rules and notes were there for times when multiple guests are staying there at the same time. We were not inconvenienced in the least throughout our stay, and all we did to ensure that things went smoothly was to communicate our agenda before arriving. We would not hesitate to stay at Chris’ place again!"
13083497,278682280,2018-06-18,41153068,Katy,This was a great house. Nice quiet street with woods in the back making it very serene. Kitchen was very well stocked for cooking.  Akhilesh was a super responsive host.  We had one issue with the TV that was solved quickly by our host.   We were glad to find a place with a bedroom and full bath on the first floor that made it great for our parents with mobility issues.  The place was very roomy for the five of us.
13083497,284499866,2018-07-01,147946878,Jennifer,Our family had a very comfortable stay plenty of room for everybody (6 people )we enjoyed a magical night on the back deck watching the fireflies ...beautiful!
13083497,285725885,2018-07-04,37307676,Gregory,"Chris’ home was perfect for my family of five and centrally located for travel in the upstate. We were there during the heat wave and while outside temps were near 100, I can confirm the air conditioning works great."
13083497,289559874,2018-07-12,195835519,Leonard,Akhilesh’s place is very clean and he made sure there was reminders all over the house which is very thoughtful and it’s very comfortable a will definitely book again when I return thanks again

13083497,303993083,2018-08-08,3831018,Patrick,"We had 2 families staying in Chris' place (4 adults, 4 kids, 1 infant).  Check-in was very simple as Chris messaged the keypad code and instructions the morning of check-in.  The house was big enough that we were all able to have our preferred sleeping arrangements and not get in anyones way.  The toddler bed and crib were a great touch if traveling with young children.  There are also toys for the kids to play with which helped keep them entertained while we checked in and out.  The location for us was great as we were close to Albany and the surrounding areas.  Shopping is very close (within 5-10 minutes).  The older boys loved hiking down to the creek in the backyard.  Overall the house was very clean and we had no issues with the house."
13083497,309069332,2018-08-17,14098373,Pat,"Large, comfortable house with room for a family. Very clean. Well stocked kitchen, with coffee, tea and fixings. Good AC. Washer and dryer save overpacking. "
13083497,310463853,2018-08-19,57169234,Mary,"This house exceeded my expectations.  It is much larger than the pictures depict on the website and very clean.  The rooms are large and the home is tastefully decorated.  Each bedroom is the size of a master suite with lots of closet space in each.  Comfortable beds with extra blankets and pillows available.  Bathrooms are large and supplied with more than enough bath towels and toiletries for all guests.  Upon entering, there was a personalized note welcoming me and my family.  The kitchen is fully stocked with condiments, kitchen essentials, pots/pans, appliances.  If you happen to forget something, I am confident this home will have it.  Located minutes off the interstate, the neighborhood is quiet with friendly neighbors.  This home is a hidden gem and I recommend it to anyone who wants a top notch AirBnb experience!"

13083497,324107914,2018-09-16,89290810,Jeet,Really nice house with great amenities and big rooms. A lot of instructions but I understand that mantaining such a property needs the guests to be considerate.

13083497,336633440,2018-10-14,202118723,Chris,"The Cape Cod is a spacious property with comfortable, quiet bedrooms with large closets.  There is a beautiful dining room able to accommodate 8+ people.   The kitchen is well lit and well equipped.   Having a full size washer and dryer is a plus.   There is a large, very private deck which overlooks a wooded area which makes it seem you are miles away from the city.   The location offers privacy, serenity and yet convenience to all that Albany has to offer."
13083497,341668191,2018-10-27,101668792,Jeni,This home is very well furnished and easy to walk into and feel at home. The bedrooms are very spacious and the beds are comfortable. The house is on a quiet and quaint street in a cute neighborhood. Chris is wonderful at responding quickly to messages and questions. The house is also located within a few minutes of numerous restaurants and a mall. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it it to anyone.

13083497,347623244,2018-11-11,7684476,Shannon,"Excellent all around — except that we were required to remove the pillowcases and sheets from our beds before checkout. None of the four of us had to ever do that before, anywhere we stayed in the world. <br/>Otherwise, I highly recommend this place."
13083497,349183697,2018-11-16,163542188,Martina,We had some issues. A lot of notes and rules everywhere in the house. Makes it feel not so homely. If you are a person who likes a very structured accommodation this would be perfect for you!
13083497,351962735,2018-11-24,91126037,Alexandra,This house was extremely clean and spacious. The kids room was stocked with toys and games which our kids loved! Everything was well organized and labeled. The kitchen is fully stocked with additional niceties like cupcake trays and condiments that you don't always see. Chris was extremely communicative and accommodated our early check in request. The property is beautiful with a very nice back deck. The neighborhood is quiet and in a great location. It was perfect for our stay!

There's a creek running through the backyard, spacious bedrooms and communal spaces, and easy access to great restaurants and shops. When I first arrived, I was a bit overwhelmed by the rules posted throughout the house - nothing unreasonable, they're just hanging up in every room and hallway. Ultimately, my friends and I had no problems with the place, and we enjoyed a great weekend in this beautiful home."

And while it’s a little tucked away on the side streets, that just means it’s nice and quite, but still very close to all kinds of places to shop and eat.<br/>The host was very helpful and quick to respond to any questions.  I’d totally recommend a trip there to anyone who needs to stay in the Albany area."

It was very clean and organized, very spacious as well and the owner was very quick to respond to our queries. I highly recommend this place."

13083497,595035867,2020-01-19,91853391,Adalgisa,"What we thought was a great weekend at a nice house ended in a negative way. Basically being forced to make another cleaning fee payment when we already paid one initially , over a small amount of confetti and balloons. We cleaned up all the garbage, made sure the house was left neat ,all dishes washed, beds made (but apparently have to be stripped by us) only a few small pails upstairs had a little bit of garbage that was an issue for them as well. Maybe they need a better cleaning service that is able to complete a job they are already being paid for from the start and every little small thing not be an issue. Especially with a house of this size regardless of the fact it will take time to clean from top to bottom. Just a very unpleasant and unreasonable host."
13083497,603381770,2020-02-09,309826304,Yan,This house is very clear and location is convenient. We were enjoyable here，next time we will recommend to my friends to stay here. The househost is very kind and nice.

13083497,624928372,2020-05-16,146697727,Lydia,"We stayed here for six weeks during the covid-19 outbreak.  It made a great home away from home, and Chris was very helpful when we needed to extend our stay.  The home was much larger than expected - 4 bedrooms plus an office/baby room.  My son loved the toys.  The location is perfect.  The neighbors were super nice and we enjoyed hearing the mini waterfall in the back of the house.  Very convenient location to stay and we will consider it when we are back in the area for holidays and events.  Thanks, Chris!"
13083497,635710657,2020-07-07,91720298,Carla,"My two friends and I stayed at this house for a short COVID-escape mini-vacation, largely spending the time staying in the house and cooking our meals. The short of it is that the house was not perfect, but we had an overall pleasant experience. I think our experience in the house deserves a review with the details for future potential guests, so here goes.<br/>First, the good. The house comes with a terrace that is directly in front of what seems to be a wild mass of grass and trees. You can see glimpses of the creek that’s advertised on the post. The view was pleasant, and very green, and hanging out on the terrace reading a book or just enjoying the sun was a nice experience. The kitchen is also relatively well stocked with dishware, utensils, and nonperishable goods like sugar, salt, etc. It’s an eclectic collection, probably thanks more to the guests that have stayed before than to the hosts themselves. The rooms are clean, cute, and spacious, and the bathrooms are similarly unobjectionable; generally, the photos are true to life (with some variations, like cheaper deck/terrace furniture and a cheap but waterproof/protective tablecloth on the dining table). Finally, there are some cute decorations around the house, particularly in the dining room.<br/>Now, the bad. In all, there wasn’t anything that ruined the experience, as these were relatively minor. As I said earlier, we had a pleasant time. But this house did feel unloved and uncared for. The mattresses, for the most part, felt too old and sunken in to be truly comfortable (except for the one in the room immediately to the left of the stairs upstairs--my friend enjoyed the firm mattress on that bed). The kitchen equipment was perfectly adequate, but the pans were beaten up and old, the utensils mismatched and many of them permanently stained, and in general the kitchen just felt unmanaged, a hodge-podge of things people likely had left behind. (On the other hand, we almost always found what we needed for our cooking.) Also, there are stern, wordy, and often repetitive signs throughout the house with dire warnings. The two welcome binders are just full of instructions and rules (speaking of which, expect to see a long laundry list of clean-up tasks you’ll have to agree to just before you book this place -- makes you wonder what exactly the non-negligible cleaning fee is going toward if you’re stripping the beds, wiping down the bathrooms, and taking out the garbage yourself) rather than any clues about local attractions, restaurants, etc. <br/>The biggest disappointment was the lack of access to the stairs and creek behind the house that’s advertised in the AirBnB post. According to a sign, the stairs have been off-access for over a year (June 2019). And sure enough, what little you can see of the stairs are covered by overgrown grass and bushes, and for all we know, the stairs broke off or are falling apart a little bit further down. The sign proclaims that the stairs were not accessible due to circumstances “out of control” of the hosts. My friends and I were disappointed to find that access to the creek/waterfall was falsely advertised (or you had to take the risk yourself and brave the stairs despite the sign, which we didn’t do).<br/>In all, the house is nicely set up, but it didn’t make you feel welcomed.. But if you’re looking for a decent house with the usual amenities that’s located in Albany, it’s an option to consider. Plus, I hope that this review helps the hosts make some improvements to the posting and/or the house, and therefore improve future guests’ experience."
13083497,647023477,2020-08-05,164490847,Mark,"This is a huge home at a great price overlooking a creek with a deck in a beautiful area. Staying here was just what we needed during our travels. With such amazing value, I even wondered if it was a share when we walked in but it was all ours! Buddha is in the garden and treats his guests with all the house a family could need. THANKS AGAIN!"
13083497,660629431,2020-09-05,81812453,정하,The place was clean and comfortable and communication by the host excellent. It provided everything we needed for our stay.
13083497,663000907,2020-09-11,23992,Martha,"My family stayed here while passing through Albany on our way back home to Brooklyn.  The house is HUGE — much bigger than I anticipated from the photos. There are just three of us, including a toddler (we made use of the toddler bed/crib and she loved getting to explore the toys and books stocked in the kids room/office).  It was way bigger than we needed and we were easily able to spread out and balance me working from home (WiFi works best/fastest close to the router upstairs) while my daughter played and enjoyed her day with my husband.  <br/>We only interacted with Chirs, the host, once.  We noticed that the garbage bins were full upon our arrival and wondered if we were supposed to bring them to the curb for trash pick-up.  He was immediately responsive and apologetic as he’d thought he’d arranged someone to take care of that for us.  I was confident that he’d be easy to reach if we had a need.<br/>Overall the space was well-appointed, and including a lot of thoughtful touches.  We appreciated being able to check in using keyless entry. The kitchen while, as some have mentioned, a bit of a mismatch, contains everything you need for cooking and eating at home The bed we slept in was comfortable and the thermostat made it easy to regulate the temperature (no easy feet for such a big, sprawling home!).  The deck was beautiful and it made us feel like we were away in the country even though we were actually very near to all of the amenities of Albany. .  We arrived by train and made it here in our rental car in only 15 minutes.<br/>I’m a frequent, long time Airbnb user.  I have stayed at about 3 dozen different Airbnb properties over the past 10 years.  I sometimes say that you can categorize Airbnb properties into two categories — those that are someone’s home/residence that they rent out on the side and those that exist solely as rental properties.  These two kinds of spaces have different feels, amenities, and pros/cons.  This space is solidly in column two.  This is not a primary residence but very clearly a rental property.  <br/>In some ways this house reminded me most of a beach cottage or mountain cabin one might rent.  A little tired from many guests, silverware and dishes that aren’t all from the same matched set, occasional homey decorations, a great collection of toys from many eras, and more magazines than anywhere this side of a dental office.<br/>I think that life as a rental property probably explains what was the most intriguing/confusing note in reviews I read before we checked in. Multiple reviewers mention “signs” and “posted rules” and I wasn’t sure what they were referring to. I thought it was worth clarifying what these reviews are referencing since I was confused myself before I got to the house.<br/>It would almost not be worth mentioning — it really didn’t impact our stay overall — but there, in fact, more than 25 signs hanging around the house (I counted, I couldn’t help myself).  Probably ~8 are are almost identical  “house policies” / “check out checklist signs” — these signs hang in the kitchen, in the hallways, and on some of the doors to the rooms.  Other signs are  “keep the doors locked”, WiFi passwords, warnings of a zero tolerance policy towards additional guests, No Smoking signs, , warnings not to lean on railings, instructions for the thermostat, etc.<br/>The signs themselves and some of the information they contain imply that this house is sometimes or has been rented as a large boarding house with each bedroom rented to a separate individual  (on the repeated policies lists there are notes including “Bathroom usage — Please be mindful of other guests who might be waiting for the bathroom”). It gives the space the feel a little bit of sleeping in an empty dorm or hostel. However, while the signs are an odd anomaly and can throw you off a bit if you were expecting a lived-in home-away-from home, it doesn’t actually impact the experience of the space."

A great value that allowed us to have a home base for a weekend full of activities.  A very quiet and private residential neighborhood, not far from stores, and only a short drive into the city center.  The host was very responsive and helpful."

13083497,769253872,2021-06-12,214652570,Bri,"CAUTION!! PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING!! Upon arrival i noticed that the back deck furniture was old and dirty. The couch that he shows where you can lay back on is DIRTY and RUSTED. Looks like it hasn’t been cleaned since he took those pictures as well as some of the furniture is replaced. There was white chairs and they both was dirty with brown,old rain water and leaves. When i brought it to the host attention he told me it was out of his control due to weather and told me i was overreacting and I should just “wipe it off and put a towel over the couch”. I understand that weather is out of someone’s control however those white chairs are as the only thing wet meaning it was like that sitting there for awhile. It wasn’t until I told him that I contacted Airbnb when he sent a housekeeper to wipe it off. Not actually clean it. Then he requires you to clean the either house SPOTLESS before leaving and does not provide any supplies. No mop. No broom. No pods for the dishwasher. I had to buy a broom myself. He doesn’t clean the blankets in the property after every guest. He has a sign on the refrigerator that says it’s cleaned only twice a month. Due to me contacting Airbnb he retaliated by telling Airbnb false allegations against me and also tried to charge me an extra $179 in cleaning fees which he never received. Once I explain to Airbnb the situation I was deemed a refund due to lack of HIS cleanliness. It is not family friendly. Would not recommend bring family or children."
13083497,404308819476940884,2021-07-11,99144024,Michelle,"We had a great stay at this home with two families of three, including two very active toddlers. There was plenty of room, with both an upstairs and a downstairs bedroom options. The backyard is a ravine, which is not safe for children, but they had a great time running around the front yard and introducing themselves to the neighbors and their pets. Very conveniently located to SUNY Albany, and a short drive from popular downtown restaurants and Washington Park."

There were no hidden surprise issues, the house was just as photographed. There is ample space for the amount of people the bedrooms hold so we were all able to gather together in both the living room and dining room. That was much appreciated by all. The toddler room was a bonus."

13083497,576768962880709601,2022-03-06,2693507,Robyn,"We loved the location - very convenient to Albany and Schenectady.  Comfortable beds, a quiet neighborhood.  We didn't try it out - but the oversized jacuzzi tub in the 2nd floor bathroom was a surprise!  The playing cards on the dining room table were also a pleasant surprise!"
13083497,585518195611695324,2022-03-18,141695612,Jennifer,Very accommodating and comfortable space
13083497,592690427169870169,2022-03-28,60311201,Thomas Scott,"Chris, the host, makes everything very easy. He gives excellent instructions and timely communication throughout the stay. Gaining access to the home was stress-free and breeze; checking out was uncomplicated. We had a little glitch trying to operate the television (I'm sure it was our fault!) and he deftly talked us through the solution. Had us up and running in no time. Everything was just as advertised. He stocks the home, including the kitchen, with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Keeps the home tidy and clean. No-step entry to the home, with a driveway right alongside the kitchen door, was perfect for getting our 94-year old grandmother from the car and into house. Large and spacious rooms with an open layout allowed her to come and go freely  throughout the day while we prepared meals, enjoyed family games in the dining room and watching movies in the family room. Loved the location: near the airport, our grandmother's retirement facility, several quality grocery stores and tasty restaurants."
13083497,597023503787189907,2022-04-03,4507164,Diane,"The place was clean and the rooms were spacious. There were a lot of instructions on pretty much every room that were overwhelming and made me feel like I was already in trouble for staying there, but overall the actual place worked out for us while we were visiting family."
13083497,607224908919128993,2022-04-17,149691751,Karen,"house is well located for access to Albany.  Very spacious, with huge bedrooms.  Kitchen has all the essentials and downstairs bath has a washer and dryer."
13083497,618039732919154691,2022-05-02,416900678,Colleen,"Overall the place was clean, spacious and quiet.  There were plenty of bed for our guests."
13083497,627541953677837999,2022-05-15,18323086,Molly,"Not what we expected. Definitely a disappointing airbnb stay. The house needs some work and had multiple issues. The furniture and decorations look straight out of a yard sale, just old, nothing matches. The towels were old and smelled bad. The beds were fine, but after stripping the sheets as required, very grossed out by the yellow mattress pads. It just felt run down and not completely clean. There were passive aggressive signs everywhere. I've stayed in much better places in Albany. Look elsewhere if you can."
13083497,633312618668987930,2022-05-23,229449159,Michael,Rental was as expected. Comfortable and private. Host was a helpful communicator.
13083497,647842530470065609,2022-06-12,423915048,Hubert,Our second stay at this property. It is the perfect base for the family to stay for a graduation weekend.
13083497,683297148481038756,2022-07-31,92169867,Naela,Very good communication and response from the host. Old house but clean and has big bedrooms . Good location.
13083497,734808570252408676,2022-10-10,304750974,Jeffrey,It was great.
13083497,768846946178770450,2022-11-26,60311201,Thomas Scott,We had a wonderful return visit to Chris' property and it was even better than the first time! This is a great property at a super price and Chris is a first-rate host.
13083497,828246671894642762,2023-02-16,458739301,Trey,Very helpful and accommodating. Clean house with a spectacular view
13083497,837043041385953691,2023-02-28,166087530,Beth,The location was great.  We really enjoyed the beautiful view in the back of the creek.  There was plenty of room for five adults.  It snowed several days during our stay but the house was warm and comfortable.  The pictures are an accurate depiction of the house.
13083497,852160700774126659,2023-03-21,113237723,Cory,A great host! We will be back in about a month. Thanks for the hospitality 😊
13083497,876119541250601841,2023-04-23,506716362,Shari,We enjoyed our short time at this Airbnb.  It had everything one would need.  The bedrooms were very large and roomy.  Akhilesh was very responsive when reaching out to him.
13083497,886193205118008897,2023-05-07,300102137,Brittany,"Overall, it was an ok space. There were a lot of rules posted everywhere. The trash goes out Wednesday and we had to bring the cans in Friday when we arrived, so they sat there. Tnere were no sheets on some of the beds and no wash cloths. You can tell that some of the rooms had rugs put over the existing carpet to hide soiled/work carpet and some of the furniture was wobbly."
13083497,901470894562641976,2023-05-28,511458244,Kerry,This listing was accurately described in the listing. Akhilesh was very responsive. We enjoyed sitting on the back porch. I would recommend this home for a comfortable stay in Albany.
13083497,907311189818652169,2023-06-05,262384124,Hannah,"This home is spacious, comfortable, and clean. My husband and five children spent a weekend there. The house has everything you might need. (My kids especially enjoyed the toys in the office/play room.) The neighborhood is quiet yet close to various areas of Albany. We really enjoyed ourselves!"
13083497,950808093627755625,2023-08-04,400973448,Brooke,Nice home in good neighborhood
13083497,983327085216558009,2023-09-18,449417528,Rebecca,"Not Fancy, but Very Functional <br/>Major good points:  Generously-sized, generously-stocked house convenient to highway, shopping, and SUNY Albany.  Plenty of beds and linens.  Very well-supplied kitchen, dining room seats 8, perfect for family meals.  Lovely stairs down to creek view in back.  Off-street parking.<br/>Minor bad points:  The large number of posted reminder signs detract from relaxation.  The decor and furnishings are all older:  usable, but used."
13083497,997923941331148112,2023-10-08,393580898,Cheryl,"We came for a family wedding. Family members arrived from England, Kentucky, NY, MA, CT and ME. Six adults from 6 places. This space nicely accommodated us and all of our needs. (I rent a home, so understand the need for rules. It just shows you care about your property.) It rained all weekend and the property was conveniently located and large enough we could get together inside to eat at the table and lounge in the living room. We would consider staying again for a similar event. The keypad entry made it easy for all of us to come and go. Thanks for a nice stay."
13083497,1004373417301031426,2023-10-17,239857026,Nicole,This was a great spacious place for the four of us. It is ideal for my elderly parents who used the main floor bedroom and bath. The host is very helpful and responsive.
13083497,1008029826957396276,2023-10-22,347207400,Jessica,"My stay was great, didn’t really have any issues. The area is nice and  quiet. Host was friendly and at our service at anytime. Will definitely rebook again."
13083497,1032699544734971169,2023-11-25,60795401,Jennifer,Perfect stay for visiting our college student for Thanksgiving. Communication was great with the host.
13083497,1048672279304476748,2023-12-17,7125823,David,"Very clean, spacious home with a responsive host."
13083497,1056609575761755507,2023-12-28,415957311,Martha,We had a great stay! No issues!! Would recommend for family visits!
13083497,1063131111573767328,2024-01-06,175065956,Norman,We had difficulty with consistent wi-fi. We did restart the router but it continued to be problematic. I had two online meetings scheduled. had to cancel one meeting and had very poor connection during the other.
13083497,1120294812866494932,2024-03-25,45561312,Caitlin,"Great stay! This house is so much more spacious than it looks like it should be from the front. Akhilesh's photos are accurate! Beautiful view of the river and trees out the back. We visited during a snowstorm, so there was no sitting on the deck, but it would be lovely to in the right seasons. Akhilesh/Chris was very responsive and helpful, and our extended family had everything we needed to celebrate my mother-in-law's 85th birthday!"
13083497,1134881958998422188,2024-04-14,420572907,Christopher,Very nice place to stay
13083497,1154384058341768638,2024-05-11,217439719,Kevin,We had a wonderful stay at Akhilesh's spacious and lovely home for our son's graduation from SUNY Albany.  The location and space were perfect.  The rooms were perfect and instructions clear.  We will definitely return in the future for visits to Albany.
13083497,1155853578153598643,2024-05-13,199755176,Lisa,"We rented Akhilesh's home because our daughter was graduating with her Masters from UAlbany.  The size of the house is actually quite misleading from outside.  It looks like a small house, but once you get inside, it is very spacious and beautiful!  We had plenty of room to gather together and celebrate as well as our own rooms to spread out as needed.<br/>The house was clean and stocked with all of the things you would use/need at home to prepare meals, bath linens and comfortable beds and furniture.  Akhilesh was great with communication and provided the necessary information for ease of access.<br/>Overall, we were very pleased with the home and accommodations and would recommend this home and the owner to anyone looking to stay in Albany.  We would absolutely rent from Akhilesh again!<br/>Thanks so much!<br/>The Schmid Family"
13083497,1175422843188092949,2024-06-09,570905739,Karin,"It’s an older home with older furnishings, however, everything was polished and clean, and just reminded me of my grandmother‘s house growing up. The towels and bedding smelled very fresh, which really stood out to me if you don’t mind few old house sounds then this is the place for you. we didn’t get to spend a lot of time at the home because we were there for a tournament but it was nice and comfortable coming back to and very close to the mall which has tons of stuff to do and plenty of shopping."
13083497,1205908840544779885,2024-07-21,28856735,Kenneth,Awesome place to stay<br/>Thanks.
13083497,1211635751171204339,2024-07-29,584087054,Rayson,"Great place peaceful and quiet, had everything I need from kitchenware, living room,rooms to dining room, one of the closest door in one of the room need to be fix... but it's an awesome place for families and people who like private and peaceful... it's close to stores gas station and the mall."
13083497,1213814479245798128,2024-08-01,572860560,Andrea,"Very spacious home, larger bedrooms for our family of four and our in-laws. We enjoyed sitting around the large dining room table after moving our son into UALBANY."
13083497,1226177213474126810,2024-08-18,82513259,Ellen,"Spacious, comfortable, and well-equipped home. Plenty of room for all 7 of us. Big kitchen with everything we needed for cooking a complete dinner and breakfast. Felt like home!"
13083497,1231930693669336439,2024-08-26,446985318,William,"Akhilesh's description of his place being a ""Pristine Cape Cod"" and ""Immaculate"" is TOTALLY FALSE.  The house is very old, run down and not well kept at all.  There is dirt and mold in the bathroom shower and sink areas, kitchen sinks and in the tiled floor areas.  The outdoor furniture is disgusting and practically unusable.  I have pictures of all of this as proof.  The ""glowing"" past reviews are either false or from people who have a VERY low bar of expectations.  All in all, this place was a total rip off for what we paid for it.  For what Akhilesh is charging. I would NOT recommend it to anyone!"
14316232,92133823,2016-08-07,43045856,Juan,Very comfortable room in a centrally located area. Easy to get to and from on my travels
14316232,97768693,2016-08-28,87817276,Peter,Great experience with Nick. I stayed there for 3 weeks and the room was as described. Shared spaces were kept very clean. Nick and Liz made me feel welcome. I would stay there again if I'm ever in Albany.
14316232,99779146,2016-09-05,33665801,Alicia,"House has antique charm and you won't find a better location for out of towners looking to explore the area (walk to Lark St, Washington Park, and downtown Albany). Nic and Liz are experienced hosts and it definitely shows through their communication! Some highlights: keypad front entry, more than adequate linens, towels, shampoo and conditioner, and smart TV in room with Netflix account. "
14316232,101840613,2016-09-15,91821185,Stephen,Nice clean room with a new TV
14316232,102585986,2016-09-18,1663567,David,"The home was completely comfortable.  I enjoyed my stay and the happy, welcoming licks from the dog.  "
14316232,103265442,2016-09-21,81332720,Marilyn,"THESE PEOPLE I BOOK WITH WHEN I CAN. THE VALUE IS GREAT., COMPANY IS GREAT. HOSTS ARE VERY CONSIDERATE AND FRIENDLY. STAYED IN A DIFFERENT ROOM THIS TIME, THE MATTRESS WAS EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE! ENJOYED STAY . MY HUSBAND AND I HOPE TO SEE THEM SOON!"
14316232,104439568,2016-09-26,5803027,Jason,"This was my best airbnb experience I have had in my three years of using this service. The details allow a guest to feel at home, as soon as you enter through the front door you can sense the beauty of the house and hosts. "
14316232,111216812,2016-10-30,1598373,Sami,"Great room, awesome hosts, ideal location for rotating medical students, only minutes to AMC.  Nick and Liz made me feel welcome and part of the family, and bella was a gem. I would stay again without thinking twice. Room is small but I found it adequate for my stay. "
14316232,111776283,2016-11-01,47390795,Amie,"Absolute pleasure staying with Nick, Liz and Bella! Awesome room, very clean, safe location and close to all kinds of restaurants and bars. If I find myself in Albany again I will definitely stay again!"
14316232,112581955,2016-11-06,7702001,Jason B,"We had a great stay. The house is great and the hosts are wonderful too. The proximity to anything Albany is perfect. The neighborhood is a bit loud (weekend nights), but I gladly forgive this because we got to bring our doggie with us and I'm pretty sure he has a massive crush on their doggie. Fantastic experience. Oh and street parking was always available."
14316232,113689956,2016-11-13,72020425,Eden,"The hosts were so awesome and welcoming! Upon arrival, they gave us the perfect amount of information about the room, the neighborhood, and local attractions. They made us feel welcome around the whole house and even let us play with their dog!"
14316232,116669999,2016-12-02,16888002,Nathan,"Liz and Nick were very nice hosts, friendly people. Very friendly and outgoing dog. The room was clean and comfortable. Easy to get in and out of the house without disturbing anyone. "
14316232,121875407,2016-12-19,11575642,Tom,Nice place. 
14316232,122433791,2016-12-23,79035410,Matthias,If you're in Albany I highly recommend Nick and Liz 's place. A small cosy house wich feels like a home. They were really friendly and helpful with everything we asked about. Everything was clean and they made our stay way more comfortably than we ever expected. Thank you for the good time.
14316232,141903162,2017-04-05,13109603,Joe,"Really great deal, especially for the price. Within walking distance to a ton of fun things, very clean and quiet, and the host was very quick in responding to any questions I had."
14316232,143617315,2017-04-12,68737915,Katessa,"The house is so cozy, & the bed is so comfortable! Loved it & highly recommend staying here. Great host! "
14316232,150330282,2017-05-07,91097955,Jeff,Absolutely amazing experience! 
14316232,152856702,2017-05-18,55679242,Anne,"La description laissait présager un logement sympathique et accueillant.  Nous avons été déçus. Le matelas n'est pas de très bonne qualité. Le sur-matelas n'arrange rien. Il vaut mieux ne pas regarder sous le lit. Côté accueil,  le propriétaire n'a pas cherché à nous rencontrer... Points positifs, la décoration de la chambre est plutôt réussie et le stationnement facile."
14316232,153656319,2017-05-21,40316237,Mariah,"This place was great. You really have the privacy you need. Cute home and rooms. Great location, close to downtown Albany. "
14316232,166817844,2017-07-04,102522793,Jonathon,The room was exactly as pictured in the photos. <br/>I stayed here with my fiancée and our small dog for the July 4th weekend. We wanted to get away and hike the region. Nicholas place was the perfect spot to do this from. Upon arrival we found the log book which listed his favorite hiking spots in the area which we definitely checked out. <br/>The house itself is walkable to the main toad but far enough away to be outside the city. It was he perfect blend of quite but not secluded quite. <br/>The bathroom which is on the first floor had something I haven't seen in a home before (a stand up men's urinal). It also had the standard toilet but be warned it's under the stairs so if your tall don't stand up fast or you may bump your head. <br/>Overall I highly recommend staying here and exploring the area either on foot or by car. 
14316232,168895661,2017-07-10,45008394,Dominic,"Great place, large house with backyard and great location near Washington Park, the Madison Theatre and the colorful Lark Street."
14316232,169745076,2017-07-13,51075334,Jeff,I was thrilled with the location and value and would definitely come back.  The house dog Bella is super friendly and really made it for me!  The wifi was super fast (their 30 MB vastly outperformed Verizon Fios 100 MB at my other house) and I really enjoyed the speed of Netflix and other options available on all the TV's.  
14316232,170056172,2017-07-14,80944287,Julia,"Sadly, I was unable to keep the reservation due to a family emergency."
14316232,174654077,2017-07-26,128869181,Leslie,"Wonderful, welcoming home! Just like the pictures. Friendly, considerate owners and friendly guests. It was truly a life saver and a comfortable, peaceful place to stay."
14316232,184382157,2017-08-19,2039476,Cynta,"This is the perfect place to stay if you just want a clean, quiet, friendly lodging in a central location.  Nick is a nice man; open, available and willing to make his place great."
14316232,202516344,2017-10-11,125406424,Corey,Perfect...<br/>Perfect room<br/>Perfect location<br/>Perfect atmosphere
14316232,204959926,2017-10-20,15104341,Armand,Good value and a short Uber trip to where I needed to go.
14316232,219096433,2017-12-16,152638542,Anh,"Nick's place was conveniently located, really close to Albany medical center and night life which happens mostly on central avenue. I stayed for 3 nights and it was very affordable. I did not meet Liz or Nick but they could be reached via text messages.<br/>The only small thing was that my room was really cold even with the central heating on."
14316232,223744804,2018-01-01,155922546,William,Great
14316232,283271382,2018-06-29,108861842,Alex,"Place has potential, but while I stayed it was beat up, forgotten about and frustrating. I did not get what was advertised which was frustrating for the amount of money I paid for it."
14316232,294177365,2018-07-21,171044613,Edward,This was a great place. It was inexpensive but walking distance to the medical center and restaurants. The host responded quickly to questions and the room was very clean. My only complaint is that it is 4 rooms for 3 different guests but only 1 bathroom. A couple mornings I had to wait a bit to get ready for the day. 
14316232,316632632,2018-08-31,29329886,Florencia,"Chad is a very accommodating and responsive host, but I would not recommend this place to anybody. While my interactions with Chad were lovely and I wish every host was like him, I would say that my stay there was very unpleasant."
14316232,329701707,2018-09-29,198392062,John,I stayed here for my neurology rotation at Albany med. Chad's place was the perfect distance from the hospital and was always available for issues or question I had. The house had all the amenities I never thought I'd need until I actually needed them. This was my first I time using AirBnB and the host facilitated an easy and memorable experience.
14316232,356225837,2018-12-07,11607029,Sara,The host is very quick to respond and helpful. It is a great location in Albany - right on public transportation and anything else you may need to access in the area during your stay.
14316232,523431516,2019-09-03,240270181,Wade,Book this place. Outstanding!
14316232,536424981,2019-09-26,149625214,John,"Chad’s place was pretty dope, and the bedroom specifically was great. It had beautiful decor, a solid air conditioner, and a TV mounted on the wall with access to all your standard cable channels + Roku. There was also a nice little patio to lounge on out back if you bring a chair. As a medical student doing a rotation at Albany Med, it was perfect. I had to come home late pretty often and the neighborhood felt plenty safe. Parking was an issue late at night, but if you coordinate with the other air bnber’s you can make room in the driveway. Pro tips: There’s a great BBQ place directly across the street, and a spacious park just around the block. Crushing the game Chad 👍🏻"
14316232,557703235,2019-11-01,45633683,R.M.,"I stayed here during the fall season to do a subI at AMC, and couldn't recommend this place more to people. The AirBNB is 3 block walk, making it a 15 minute walk to the hospital, or a 3 minute car ride to the facility. For starters the place has a parking driveway, which made things significantly easier. With long hours on your sub-I, it was a good feeling not having to struggle to find street parking late at night, or not being crammed by the vehicles in front/behind you from the parallel parking. The room was cozy and clean and came with a pair of fresh towels with hefty comforters. The A/C unit worked perfectly fine without being too loud. The bathroom did the job without having issues of running out of hot water. Even has a urinal in the wall, which is pretty awesome. Would certainly recommend you stay here if you're coming to AMC for the month. Chad was a great host and even accommodated me during my mishap as I was driving to AMC."
14316232,621444651,2020-03-31,267635050,Amanda,"Amazing place to stay - was a guest here for extended stay doing rotations at AMC. Very close to hospital, off street parking. They have everything you need to feel at home. Hosts were exceptionally responsive - well worth the stay would recommend to anyone!!"

14316232,419439545081052907,2021-08-01,122915495,Swetha,"This room is great value for anyone working or rotating at Albany Medical Center. It looked exactly like the photos, and the bed was surprisingly comfortable. There were several smaller restaurants nearby within walking distance that were all excellent as well. My only issue with my stay was that all four bedrooms in the house were full, so sometimes there was a wait to use the one and only bathroom in the house. But I would still highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Albany, especially if they work at Albany Med!"
14316232,529708489894381241,2021-12-31,164900911,Sarah,"Chads place was a great long term stay. It had everything I needed and was quiet. There were other housemates whom I barely saw, but when I did they were super friendly. Sometimes at night the street would get loud with people by the deli, but overall it was a good location. I would recommend the stay."
14316232,834833130253392670,2023-02-25,196507891,Yuna,"Kellie and Chad’s place is great for long term stays.

I have pleasant and satisfying experience of living in their property."

14989805,127184258,2017-01-16,81966192,Courtney,"Piotr has multiple properties and had offered my party to view another property to stay at instead or to split the party for additional comfort although we felt uncomfortable doing so and declined. The place was very clean, and had plenty of necessities. Just make sure to let him know if you will be bringing any pets, because he does have certain preferences for how they will be accomodated. He was very knowledgeable about the surrounding area and gave good recommendations for places to eat. I would recommend his properties to anyone visiting Albany."
14989805,142825227,2017-04-09,60155968,Galan,"This place is fantastic. It is THE home away from home. Amenities were wonderful and plentiful. House is spotless and VERY modern. The location is close to SUNY Albany. <br/>Host was extremely accommodating and always quick to the response on communication.

14989805,634954219,2020-07-05,10148016,Samantha,Peter's place and neighborhood is very quaint. His backyard is darling and the master bedroom that leads to the backyard is definitely an added bonus. His amenities are good and was a the perfect getaway away from the city.
14989805,637867810,2020-07-13,85354982,Ryan,Beautiful home with an amazing two level back patio with plenty of seating and a Weber grill. <br/>The house is immaculate and it’s a nice quiet neighborhood.

The neighborhood is lovely and quiet but still walkable to stuff. The backyard was great for our little one to run around and we got tons of use out of the grill and porch - the upper level off of the master bedroom was particularly lovely with two great chairs for lounging! The kitchen was well stocked for cooking, the Roku's on all the TV's made it so easy to sign into our usual streaming service accounts. The Bedrooms were REALLY comfortable - great bed linens, pillows and mattresses! But the highlight of this place, especially at this time of year was the FANTASTIC AC! The place stayed cool all day every day! Great communication from the host and great hospitality! Would recommend to anyone!"

14989805,398489606477242052,2021-07-03,112486525,Monica,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Peter’s home. The house was spacious with plenty of room for our family to spread out. The kitchen was well stocked with appliances, pans, dishes for cooking. We enjoyed sitting on the back deck for our morning coffee and on the front porch for a glass of wine in the evening. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. We really appreciated how clean the home was, and check in/out was easy. This is a great place for families, couples, or a work away from home stay. We would definitely recommend and would stay again."

We met the nicest neighbors while sitting on the front porch every morning, great diverse neighborhood. Nice and quiet all day long. We used the back deck up and down a lot. The kitchen is well stocked for cooking and the dishwasher is quiet., the clothes washer and dryer are new. The beds and bedding are comfy and the whole house is very clean. There was plenty to watch on tv with the apps provided. Lastly, being just a three minute drive from Buckingham Lake was a treat. It’s a mile around in a very nice neighborhood if you want a longer walk and change of scenery close to home. Oops one more thing. Peter was responsive to all of our communications. We stayed three weeks and are looking forward to staying again!"

14989805,510173976294188263,2021-12-04,37596043,Ashley,Great home. We booked last minute after checking in to a filthy hotel in the area. Peter had his home ready for us within an hour of asking. We also had to an inconsistent schedule this week and had to ask about extending three additional times. Peter was so accommodating and wonderful.<br/>The house had everything you needed - plenty of supplies for cleaning or replenishment. The house felt clean and well kept. <br/>We enjoyed our time here and our last minute trip needs were much easier working with Peter to rent his home.

14989805,696324048381607260,2022-08-18,414527922,William,"I had a work assignment in Latham for a couple of weeks, and I brought my family with me.  It was easy to get from the house to I-87, so I had a short commute to work.  The house is on a quiet street, but there’s nice shopping and restaurants nearby on Western Ave.  We liked the dining area outside on the back patio, and the nice weather allowed us to enjoy that multiple times.  We enjoyed using the propane grill too.  Peter bought several types of coffee for the house.  I love coffee, and I enjoyed it each day."
14989805,698507007883592432,2022-08-21,258542141,Kathleen,"Peter’s home was perfect for our weekend of moving our daughter into SUNY Albany. Check in was so easy and Peter’s home was so comfortable and clean. The kitchen is fully stocked  with  appliances and cookware. The furniture in the living room is comfortable and the house was very clean. The bedrooms are comfortable. The backyard is fenced in and we had our small dog with us for part of the trip. The outside back deck is very nice and there is a bbq grill there. We did not use this space because we were busy with trips back and forth. Peter is very easy to communicate with! He also dropped off a bag of coffee and tea for us. We hope we can rent Peter’s place for future trips to Albany! He was an excellent host. Thank you, The Ayers Family"

For us, it comfortably fit two adults, one child, and a dog. The house is in a great location - near several shopping plazas, highway entrances, and the university - and it was easy to get anywhere we needed to be via car. The kitchen is well appointed, and the house has modern amenities. Peter was extremely responsive to my questions about our stay, both before and during. We hope to stay there again soon! 5 stars all around!"

It is a truly a home away from home. For our first visit, I had made some suggestions to Peter for kitchen tools that may make cooking easier.

14989805,1068910408968657985,2024-01-14,41739336,Rachel,"Peter was extremely responsive and flexible with check out date/time. The house is cozy, the kitchen has great appliances and there are plenty of towels available. The only concern was that the fenced in yard had a few different spaces that were not closed off, so the dogs escaped quite a few times. Aside from that, everything went well."
14989805,1079122991011953627,2024-01-28,434254256,Ricky,Quick response and very helpful will definitely be booking again

14989805,1155890291179437068,2024-05-13,73635268,Kylan,My family had a great time at Peter’s rental! Before booking I had reached out to Peter about clarification on whether the rental had a pack and play or full size crib. Peter let me know it was a pack and play…Peter ended up purchasing a brand new full size crib and sheets/blanket when I mentioned my infant usually sleeps in one at home. I was shocked he would go above and beyond like that to make my family’s stay so comfortable! I am truly grateful for his kindness. Thank you so much!!!!

The home 100% matches the pictures and description and is located in a very peaceful neighborhood on a road with no traffic.  Plenty of space to work or hang out inside and a large, quiet, peaceful deck in the back.  We used the grill and kitchen more then we went to restaurants during our stay.  <br/>Peter was an awesome host!!  I hope to stay again during our next stay!  <br/>Thank you!"

Peter was very kind making sure all of our needs were taken care of.  <br/>I absolutely appreciate how simple and easy the whole process was, from booking, to check-in, to check-out, it was all seamless and no issues whatsoever.  It was especially important as we had a busy schedule all weekend, and it was nice that we didn’t have to spend time with tedious tasks or figuring things out.  Location is cool too, some nice restaurants in the area. <br/>Beds were comfortable and having two bathrooms was great.  Everything was super clean.  My whole group felt the same way. <br/>Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay here again!"

The room was freshly cleaned with a mini fridge and microwave, even bottled water and small snacks. Share was a gracious host as well!"
15580397,536836805,2019-09-27,181161023,Caleb,Share is very hospitable and quick to answer any questions. The location is awesome too!
15580397,611678154,2020-02-27,102367716,Eugenia,After having troubles with other host at airbnb this place and Share made my day and trip. Thanks for the hospitality! Great place if you are a traveler willing to share culture

15580397,437600461016400904,2021-08-26,114416519,Kevin,"My stay at the ""House on the Hill"" was great. Excellent location, clean room, easy access, and a few key amenities (such as a microwave and toaster in the room). Though I did not actually meet Share, she was very responsive via text. I'll probably stay there again next time I'm in Albany."

15580397,450677833131514450,2021-09-13,210950712,Peace,"Very professional host! But, INTENSE surveillance.<br/>It's easy to see why Share is a super host. Her place is clean, organized, comfortable and safe! I can tell she takes great pride in what she does :)<br/>2 things that made me a bit uncomfortable:<br/>1. No profile picture. I'm generally ok with self check-ins. Given her desire to observe Covid precautions, this self check-in made sense. But I feel that at the very least, having a photo in the profile lends to greater transparency, trust, familiarity.....and ultimately a greater sense of trust so that you feel as if you ""know"" who you are staying with, in some sense of the word<br/>2. I respect the surveillance, especially in a college town! But on one occasion, I left the bathroom door ajar while doing my makeup, and another guest entered needing to shave. I quickly handed off the bathroom to the other guest, and all was well, no awkwardness. But I promptly got a firm warning text from Share about the episode. <br/>On another occasion, I left something in my car which was parked just outside. I ran out to my car and left the front door cracked so that I wouldn't lock myself out (I hadn't memorized the code yet and didn't have my phone). When I came back, the door was closed, locked and when I got back to my phone, I had a stern text waiting from Share, warning me not to repeat the momentary episode. <br/>Thankfully, I was able to remember the code to get back in! But I was taken back that she didn't even consider that possibly, I could have been locked out with NO way to get back in other than to wake the whole house at 1:30 am by ringing the bell. <br/>I do appreciate her rules! But it left me keenly aware of ""eyes on me"" at all times, and even a bit nervous regarding whether privacy within the private areas (bedroom/bathroom) was truly ""private"".<br/>I'm also big on warmth and hospitality, so the only communication between Share and I being stern warning texts, left me feeling unwelcomed in her house.<br/>With all this said, I still applaud Share for running such a smooth air bnb that maintains such excellent standards. But I simply felt too surveyed which lead to discomfort for the rest of my stay."
15580397,457185294115185896,2021-09-22,219474731,Oscar,"Expect great communication from the host. The room had everything I expected and more! Mini fridge with water/granola, microwave, coffee pot, bowls, napkins, plates, utensils, and tea bags… just to name a few things. Great place for the price, def recommend"

15580397,632541848750472755,2022-05-22,36563270,Danny,I rolled into Albany for a weekend course. I read the listing and new that not only the price but the accommodations were exactly what I needed. Share was an attentive host and all my needs were met during my stay. An added benefit is that within walking distance is a neighborhood with restaurants and bars as well as a nice park.

15580397,1108107612367539095,2024-03-08,49748471,Sandra,"I read the nasty reviews and booked anyway. Yes, Share has rules, don't you? It's her house, she lives alone, and lives in Albany. Although she lives in a safe neighborhood, she doesn't know you and the camera's made me feel safe. I stayed 8 nights and no issues. Her place was clean and I had everything I needed. I didn't need to use her kitchen, the microwave was sufficient. I was there to sleep and shower. If you don't like to follow rules, I don't want you staying at my house either. Move on and pay double. I would definitely stay with Share again."

The neighborhood was quiet, making it feel like I was outside the city. There were a lot of trees around the house, which kept it cool and fresh, so I rarely needed to use the fans. Having a refrigerator and microwave was very convenient. <br/>Share was quick to respond to all my questions when needed. <br/>Also, thank you for providing extra water on particularly hot days."

16531782,628486744,2020-06-08,35011062,Jenny,"Beautifully and conveniently located on one of the best streets in Albany,  this single room had all the essentials for our quick visit. As an older home, the space does have some wear and tear, but is tastefully decorated and has the basics. The host is very responsive and accommodating, and check in and check out were very easy. As is previously mentioned, the internet is not set up for a high speed work ready connection, just very limited basic needs. The kitchen nook is a small space, used just for heating things up or microwaving. Safe and quiet neighborhood and friendly host."

16531782,671530747,2020-10-05,195392122,Bruce,Good for passing through town...
16531782,671848035,2020-10-06,5237442,Diana,"The only struggleI had was with the master lock to get in. It was dark and I was doing the peepee dance trying to get the key out. I had never used one before. Otherwise, the bed was comfortable and it was great for a quick night stay. Based on the garden decor of Buddha’s and animals, Liz is a good spirit offering a place for travelers to lay their weary heads. Also, delicious soft pretzels for after hike dinner nearby. 😋"
16531782,672994829,2020-10-10,98941732,Leo,"This is my second time staying at Elizabeth's, this time in the other room. Big comfy bed, very cute room, powerful shower, all the amenities, centrally located."

16531782,703750673,2020-10-25,3603955,Desiree,"We loved our stay at Elizabeth's place. It was very quiet and cozy, and had everything one might need for a short stay. It is also in a great location, close to anything you might want to do in the area. We went apple picking at Sam Ascott Orchard, about 30 minutes away and had such a great time!<br/>The bed is a little on the soft side, if that is a consideration for how well you'll sleep. <br/>We'd love to visit again in the spring or summer when we can take a dip in the pool or sit comfortably in the garden!"
16531782,706265255,2020-11-02,197768330,Stephanie,"We really wanted to love our stay in Albany, but there were a few hiccups along the way. Here are some pros and cons that were applicable to our experience.<br/>Pros:<br/>-The location is in a very safe and peaceful neighborhood <br/>-The apartment is popped out from the main house which felt private and was overall quiet<br/>-The apartment was as pictured, felt cozy, and had a comfortable bed<br/>The Cons:<br/>-The bathroom sink was broken upon arrival and after immediately contacting our host we did not receive any response until I contacted air b&b and they contacted her, the the following morning - so communication was very poor <br/>-There were some cleanliness issues including the following: hair on the sheets/in the shower, dirty towels in the kitchen (with crust on them), dirty counters/walls in the kitchen, stained/torn towels in the bathroom,   several partially used paper towel rolls that were stained, an almost empty roll of toilet paper in the bathroom, and a tiny remnant of soap left for us in the shower, and various used cleaning supplies were left out in the entry to the bathroom, to name a few<br/>-There was a smoke detector in the room that was very old and appeared to be out of order<br/>Overall our stay was not what we expected and we would not return to this location. It definitely has potential, but the cons outweighed the pros for us."

Room is beautiful and had everything we needed.  The location could not have been better. Beautiful residential neighborhood, super safe,  with park in front of the property and a large pond near by.  Took full advantage of the great weather this week with walks and then sitting on the front porch.  Wish it had been in the summer so as to be able to swim in the pool.  will certainly stay their again and we highly recommend it."

16531782,761020397,2021-05-22,259508292,Kevin,"While my stay was very brief, it was absolutely perfect! I love staying in places that feel like a home-away-from-home, and not like a hotel room. This is one of those places! It is located in a beautiful neighborhood, with a nice little park across the street. Elizabeth was extremely friendly, and clearly does a great job with the upkeep of the property. I highly recommend this cute little place for anyone passing through Albany!"
16531782,761539668,2021-05-23,9997398,Angela,Perfect little spot to stay in Albany.

16531782,397777384564529781,2021-07-02,12079193,Emma,"The photos really don't do it justice. The studio is so very charming. It has some backyard hangout space and even a pool to chill by that I don't think was mentioned in the post? The park is nice and quiet and basically like your front yard.  I came here for a writer's retreat from NYC by train. It was the perfect place for that purpose. There's a CVS 5 mins walk away. The kitchenette even has an air fryer. There were also fresh milk, bread, butter, and ice in the fridge for me to use when I arrived. I'd definitely come back."

16531782,407182667372831945,2021-07-15,397868819,Travis,Really cute neighborhood near the hospital.  The room can feel a little cramped with things but it has everything you'll need which is the important part.  Some very ornate and nice decorations as well.  Would definitely recommend.

16531782,425343940599757170,2021-08-09,4519434,Lew,"Pros: cheap price, in a goid neighborhood, has a pool, little kitchenette<br/>Cons: in the heat of summer has no AC and no good fans, its fairly clean but kind of dingy, like cobwebs and stuff, if thats important to you, the bed is hard as a rock, the front door slams really loud so if yer not into loud noises then.....no hangers<br/>the wallpaper is really dark so it can feel gloomy, its on street level so and has louvered blinds so people can still see in, so if you need privacy, quiet, bright atmosphere this is not yer place, if none of that bothers you and you just need a cheap place to crash this place is ok"
16531782,426784111982593136,2021-08-11,159972827,Linsey,"Second time staying, beautiful place at a great value."

16531782,438280424933160576,2021-08-27,398432259,Angie,"Great little place on a quiet street. Elizabeth was a great host going above and beyond to make sure my stay was inviting and enjoyable. <br/>The extras were not expected  but so appreciated…bagels, coffee, jam, and butter available to start my day. <br/>The only suggestion would be to have the small window air conditioning unit repaired.  It got really toasty in there.<br/>Great experience. I’ll be back!"

Liz is a very accommodating host - who  was lovely to talk to and very thoughtful.  The heat was not working properly so she made sure I had an electric blanket and turned on a space heater so that when I got home the place was very warm and comfortable.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone who needs a convenient and charming location to stay in while in Albany.  .

Liz was quick to respond to a check-in inquiry. <br/>The location is great and the few food items in the fridge were a nice gesture.

I couldn’t reach her until the 2nd day and had some trouble with the hot plate, but once I reached her she attentively got things working . I would just advise you not to use both burners on the hot plate and make toast at the same time.  <br/>The neighborhood is wonderful. The street opens up into a broad courtyard that is peaceful with lots of old trees, birds, nice houses, and hardly any traffic.  Dog walkers is about all I saw.  It’s one block from New Scotland but completely quiet."

The room had a lot of charm and was quite clean and comfortable.  I was traveling alone, but felt cozy and safe.  Took a walk around the park in the morning, where I saw Robin's and bunnies and squirrels foraging around.  It was June, so there was a lot of green. Very pretty. Quiet too."

16531782,732570074179635777,2022-10-07,3704189,Mindy,"What a charming apt, with a great location. Elizabeth is a great communicator and host!"
16531782,734022105898531232,2022-10-09,16330913,Lisa,"This was the third time I stayed at Elizabeth's home.  It's easy to get to from main roads, in a pleasant neighborhood, and has the most comfortable bed in the world!"
16531782,743447305450375792,2022-10-22,61087479,M Denise,Great stay!
16531782,744240250234700766,2022-10-23,61087479,M Denise,We always enjoy staying at Elizabeth’s sweet little place!
16531782,744904067430673165,2022-10-24,25129142,Richard,"I'll preface that my fiancee was not thrilled about staying at an old house. She also found the studio a bit cluttered for her taste. I found the unit interesting if eclectic. Beware the house is somewhat difficult to identify in the nighttime for check in (no house number visible from the street). The main door key needs jiggling to open. The unit is located near a quiet park. The studio is one of the units in the house, close to the main entrance. The sounds of other occupants coming and going are heard pretty clearly from the studio. Although the neighborhood is quiet, one neighbor warmed up his car for over 10 minutes causing noticeable idling sounds that woke me up on the morning. The coffee, tea and fixings were a nice touch."
16531782,747133385589383004,2022-10-27,12834613,Richard,"Great place to stay, clean, nice location, kitchenette"
16531782,750048924767847513,2022-10-31,141114273,Florian,"This Airbnb is a gem! It's cozy and furnished with love to details. Located in a beautiful wooden house in a typical American neighborhood it offers all you need for a comfy stay while being affordable! (Plus a beautiful wooden floor that not only European hipsters will love.) Though we didn't have the opportunity to meet Elizabeth in person, communication was easy-going and replies were fast, including detailed instructions for an effortless check-in. Can recommend it in any case and would love to come back someday.<br/>This accommodation might work best for those with a (rental) car or those who rely on shuttle services like Lyft or Uber or bring/share a bike. Similar to other cities in the US of that size public transit is not fully developed and the Airbnb might be not accessible very well in off-peak time—though getting around by bus in Albany is definitely possible."
16531782,752948999251489342,2022-11-04,55588978,Erin,This is a cute and unique studio to stay in. I just stayed the night on my way further west. Lots of cute extras and plenty of towels.

16531782,758003655518198769,2022-11-11,256093872,Stephanie,"Cutest little vintage style place. I mean little literally, but it was so cozy and clean. Wifi was perfect, parking was easily accessed and the basic kitchen supplies provided. Super happy to have found this place and would 100% recommend."
16531782,759479818607201932,2022-11-13,411140252,Alexander,"Very comfortable, charming place. So unique! We are repeat visitors, always looking forward to the next stay."
16531782,768166011965211401,2022-11-25,42904228,Maura,Perfect for my parents’ visit to Albany for Thanksgiving. Great location in a nice neighborhood. Charming studio with great details. Had everything my folks needed including a very comfortable bed.

16531782,784784318823296702,2022-12-18,60086076,Bryan,A very comfortable and cozy room in a larger house.  It’s equivalent to a large hotel room in size but much homier and has a kitchenette area with amenities and a full size fridge etc. The entry to the house and access to the room is easy and private as well. Elizabeth was a responsive host and provided clear and prompt instructions about arrival. <br/>The furnishings are all very comfortable and the space has lots of character (in the best possible sense).  Definitely recommend this rental for 1 person or a couple spending a day or two in Albany.
16531782,788481119509414437,2022-12-23,326725818,Meghan,"This was the perfect room for I what i needed. I live 7 hours away from family and I didn't want to waste a visit day traveling around the holidays. it's a big room with a full bath attached. there was also a kitchenette area, a TV, a desk, a small couch, a chair, and a huge bed. it was perfect for my partner and me and the bed was very comfortable. it was walking distance from a couple of bars and we walked to one for dinner. <br/>The room was clean and ready for us when we arrived and I personally enjoyed the later check out time."
16531782,794192143644146537,2022-12-31,150294312,Koree,Super cute and quiet location!! Loved staying here!

16531782,795626259557226053,2023-01-02,226430332,Emma,"This was a lovely place filled with everything we needed. Elizabeth stocked the fridge with milk and butter, and the kitchen was stocked with spices which made cooking a quick meal easy. Check-in was very straightforward, the bed soft and comfortable, and quiet neighborhood."
16531782,800787082978763542,2023-01-09,159451272,Forrest,"We booked last minute.  Host was quick to respond, helpful, and friendly.  The place was clean, quaint, and a good value."

16531782,804371426218551779,2023-01-14,484587807,Miriam,"Very antique and lovely studio, the kitchenette was well equipped, and the location felt nice and safe. It was convient for where I needed to go and the host was understanding of my late check in."
16531782,808046052606657127,2023-01-19,494916319,Spencer,"Great studio apartment, and a great stay. Every time I stay here, it’s better than the last time. Highly recommended."
16531782,809505161004916125,2023-01-21,203103993,Judy,My husband was in the hospital nearby so this place was perfect for me.  Perfect for 1 person or a couple.
16531782,810230855262512841,2023-01-22,199280863,Samantha,"Quick and easy for an overnight stay, Elizabeth was clear with instructions to check in and some very nice personal touches to the studio. Definitely recommend"
16531782,811596335729791673,2023-01-24,203103993,Judy,"I had stayed at this place for a number of days because it was close to the hospital where my husband had been a patient, making it very convenient.  I could only book a couple of days at a time and in advance, because we were unsure how long my husband would be hospitalized.   Into the 2nd week of my on and off stay, both my husband and I contracted Covid while at the hospital.  When I contacted the owner the day before my stay and advised her that I had tested Covid positive, I requested a refund for the 2 days .  She advised me that she had a policy of requiring a week before for cancellation, which would have been impossible for me as I was only booking a couple of days in advance of my stay.  She would not refund any of my money.  I wonder if she would have preferred that I keep my reservation?  My suggestion for anyone considering renting from her would be ""Buyer Beware"" that should extenuating or unforeseen circumstances occur, you would be out your money like I was."
16531782,813797548414912761,2023-01-27,203103993,Judy,I had been staying at this place on and off for over a week while my husband is in St. Peter's Hospital.  His medical circumstances necessitated me booking the room for 2 days at a time because we did not know how long he was going to be there.  This week I had the room booked for Wednesday and Thursday and found out on Tuesday we both tested positive for Covid.  I contacted the homeowner to let her know I wouldn't be staying and I had to go home to quarantine.  I requested a refund for obvious reasons.  She informed me that her policy was for a one week cancellation request for a refund.  My suggestion for future renters is Buyer Beware.  If you have any type of emergency right before your stay you will be out any money that you paid.
16531782,818110654447156989,2023-02-02,107756532,Faye,Located in a beautiful neighborhood within walking distance or a short drive to all of Albany.

16531782,830514255011101311,2023-02-19,28301802,Yasmin,Elizabeth’s place was perfect for a quick overnight stop on my route home. Check in was easy and the studio was clean and comfortable. I really appreciated the disposable coffee cups provided so I could take a coffee with me for the start of my drive after my stay.

16531782,840591195792180360,2023-03-05,88336633,Amru,"The studio is a piece of art! I love how Liz paid attention to the tiniest details! <br/>The place is very clean, close do the city center, it has everything that you might need. <br/>The only bad thing is that I had to leave! One of my absolute best Air bnbs.<br/>Thank you, Liz :)"
16531782,844295297338999764,2023-03-10,357662412,Shirley,"Nice, quiet, and peaceful. Would stay again."

Great parking, easy to access late at night, and beautiful on the insides with lots of amenities to make it easy to feel comfortable when we had to get up and go. The room was beautiful too! Thank you!"
16531782,855795620859397207,2023-03-26,4692361,Ayesha,"Super easy to find, great neighborhood, and the perfect stop over place as I was headed to the Berkshire's."

16531782,863000808486641513,2023-04-05,85581,Patti,"I had one issue after another with the space after check in. Firstly I had a question on how to get the tv to work. I did all this through the secure AirBnB messaging. Then I noticed that the room and bathroom were dirty. By morning the heat wasn’t working and the room was at 60 degrees. Many messages later she still hadn’t gotten back to me. It took her 14 hours to respond. Most things can be rectified, but not keeping good communication, especially when you have multiple AirBnB rentals is not excusable. <br/>  In the end I had to book a Marriott for my last 2 nights, but she did reimburse me for that expense."
16531782,865940833557101046,2023-04-09,5845079,Sherilee,Elizabeth's apartment was perfect for our visit. The bed was extremely comfortable and the apartment had everything we needed. The neighborhood is also very nice!

16531782,891361490027600390,2023-05-14,76749140,Michele,"The apartment is on the ground floor of an old house in a peaceful neighborhood. The house is old but has character and the apartment was comfortable. comfortable bed, seating area, desk, small kitchen, and bathroom. It was very warm during the days the spring weekend we were there. there was no air conditioner installed yet but the apartment stayed cool and we could open a window at night. There are clusters of restaurants and bars within a 5 minute drive, and the location is about halfway between downtown and university of Albany."
16531782,893531595631976385,2023-05-17,474203845,Kaitlin,"A beautiful comfy place to stay, walking distance from St. Peters. I will definitely try to come back. Liz was great and a friendly host."
16531782,900695984551985456,2023-05-27,172241699,Caroline,Elizabeth had prompt and clear responses. The neighborhood was quiet and the stay was comfortable - definitely preferable to a motel or similar for my quick stay!
16531782,902226185324374772,2023-05-29,481888239,Oda,"A nice little place for our needs! The room was cozy and had lots of character, with great amenities for most needs. Parking was easy. The place did however have quite a fiddly lock, and when we experienced problems with our shower, we did not hear from the host on our inquiry neither during or after our stay. There were a couple cobwebs in the bathroom and the food in the fridge had gone bad a month ago. That being said, it did fill our needs for a quick stop over, with a comfy bed, a place to make our tea and all around a safe ans cozy neighbourhood for a super fair price 😄"
16531782,903675288944445437,2023-05-31,117772490,Madeleine,"Beautiful, charming little apartment in a great location if you’re in the area for a concert, or just to explore Albany! We were visiting to see Noah Kahan at The Palace Theatre, and it was a perfect spot to spend the night. Super easy to get downtown from there. Bonus: mattress is very comfortable!<br/>Only issue with the stay was that the apartment was quite dusty, and there were scattered bits of trash in corners of the apartment/on shelves (i.e. a couple of shriveled blueberries, open tea bags strewn about shelves, random wrappers). However, still leaving 5 stars because the place was really affordable for what it is, and the important areas you need clean were fine. It is an old house, so dust is somewhat inevitable, but it could’ve been a bit cleaner for sure. Would absolutely still recommend it!"
16531782,905817681017516050,2023-06-03,195987693,Alessandro,"Nice place to stay in a quiet and relaxing neighborhood, highly recommended!"

16531782,920271181577912712,2023-06-23,386145865,Allan,Very nice and cozy. Definitely worth the visit and would stay again.

16531782,926151924395650584,2023-07-01,150614281,Tiffany,Her studio is super cute with an amazing backyard. It was perfect for what we needed. She has taken a small space and used it very wisely to creatively put in place everything that you need. It's a great quiet neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again.
16531782,927518465848811932,2023-07-03,171287104,Gabriella,"We had a fine time. Be sure to ask questions- with typos in parking instructions, we found it difficult to find the right spot. Also, be warned that while you have the studio, you are still very much in a shared house with other apartments (we struggled with the the doors and getting our bags in when arriving and the next afternoon we were encouraged to be more careful about the doors slamming in a note left on the door). This is a shared space, know that the other folks in the building are paying attention to you!"
16531782,929791383705045503,2023-07-06,368986388,Colin,"We loved Liz's place! The bed is SO comfortable, and the space is simply beautiful. I'd live here if I could. Thank you, Liz!"

16531782,939880433780494885,2023-07-20,120945626,Manon,"L'hôte n'a pas répondu à notre courriel (pas de savon dans la douche, manque d'une taie d'oreiller, pas de mouchoir). Elle a seulement communiqué avec nous avant l'arrivé et lors de notre départ (par courriel). <br/>L'aménagement est bien. Les photos sont représentatives. <br/>La localisation est parfaite. Très beau quartier sécuritaire et tranquille. La propreté n'est pas top (poussière, micro onde sale, bouilloire sale et vielle eau) mais le reste est OK. <br/>Le lit est très confortable. On aurait aimé plus que deux oreillers mais bon , on en a trouvé une autre dans le rangement (sans taie). <br/>Elle devrait changer les serviettes de bain (grands trous).<br/>Beaucoup de postes de télé, bon ventilateur de plafond, air climatisé fonctionne bien. On ne retournerait pas mais c'était correct pour le prix."
16531782,941366042568923751,2023-07-22,243430138,Victoria,Was passing through town and stayed for a night. The area is very cute and the house was perfect for my needs.

The studio was exactly what was described and the pool was extra relaxation and enjoyment. What stood out to us was the restful quietude of the neighborhood, I actually slept in."

It is conveniently located just minutes from area hospitals, restaurants, and breweries.  Liz keeps her rooms clean, clutter-free, and comfortable.  I would absolutely recommended Liz's Place."
16531782,952889850523875569,2023-08-07,11309408,Adrienne,This is a good studio room for the price. It has a bit of an old house smell but a comfortable bed and good place to sleep for the night.

16531782,963022920521871216,2023-08-21,157394076,Natalie,"Liz’s place is comfortable and adorable. I love the antique Victorian styling. The kitchenette is very useful, I don’t like to eat out every meal while on the road. Repeat guest in both suites and I’ll be booking again the next time I’m in Albany!"
16531782,963741319277094193,2023-08-22,204290,Jess,Great comfortable space in a quiet neighborhood.  I wish we could have stayed longer.

16531782,966647757863371448,2023-08-26,528500187,VIcki,Beautiful accommodation in a  lovely neighborhood. Highly recommend

16531782,968136077772177910,2023-08-28,411501626,Rachel,"We really liked Elizabeth’s place. It was a small studio space but everything we needed was there. There was a little kitchenette area with a hot play, cookware, a sink, a toaster oven, and a full sized fridge. The bathroom was stocked and the bed had plenty of blankets and pillows. Nice and clean. We loved the windows looking out into the garden."
16531782,970367197118330713,2023-08-31,106009853,Yuridia,"If I could give 6 stars I definitely would! This house is by far the most beautiful and authentic place I have ever stayed at! If you want to get an impression of how these beautiful country old houses look like from the inside, this stay is all what you need. As a history lover, it was just wonderful as the decoration has been really kept in its original style. The studio was equipped with everything. A nice tv and a beautiful bed, practical kitchen and nice bathroom. An old fashioned desk with some nice info on Albany and a cozy sitting area. The place is in a very quiet and green neighborhood and it’s close from the city center. A great starting point to discover Albany. I would truly recommend this hidden gem if you want to have a unique experience."

16531782,974686097815163431,2023-09-06,91065016,Danielle,We had a lovely stay in the Blue Suite.  It was the perfect amount of space for the 2 of us and we were thankful for the AC and fan during a heatwave! The bed was a soft place to land at the end of our busy days.
16531782,976169669312619587,2023-09-08,160910899,Joseph,A nice place to stay in the Albany area.

16531782,980509553448630015,2023-09-14,514020846,Jocelyn,"The area was so quiet and peaceful. It’s located in a great spot in Albany. It’s really close to the NYS museum which was great to visit, as well as some nice restaurants downtown. The outside patio is really well maintained and beautiful. Checking in/out was extremely easy and the studio is clean. Overall it was really nice and I’ll hopefully be visiting again."
16531782,982618390540552065,2023-09-17,386143998,Mandy,"Wonderful time staying here. We came in late, and was able to sleep in because of the noon check out. This was our second time here and things were consistent with the first stay. We will stay again!"

16531782,997186307005050076,2023-10-07,24525802,Teri,"This studio is located on the first floor of a charming old home. The front porch is outfitted with inviting wicker furniture for relaxing in and from which you can take in the extensive gardens. The location is very central - near small shops, dining options, a college & hospital.<br/>The neighborhood is very walkable and quiet and the bed was very comfortable. I met Elizabeth as I was leaving and she was very friendly, which was consistent with her messages to me before our one-night stay.<br/>With a deep cleaning, this would have been a 5-star experience!"
16531782,1001503203316546870,2023-10-13,338510658,Elizabeth,Lovely stay-we had to find the house at night which was slightly challenging but everything was exactly as described. Very clean and tidy. Kitchenette and bathroom well stocked. Would stay again if needed :)

16531782,1007252338751782266,2023-10-21,340971860,Mikayla,"Our short time in the apartment was very good. Although some things seemed a bit dated or in need of an upgrade, it still had everything we needed and then some. We never got to meet Liz, but her instructions to get in were easy enough."
16531782,1007975316924764985,2023-10-22,520855394,Andrew,"TERRIBLE!!!!<br/>Elizabeth has bad communication and is miserable. My girlfriend and I stayed here last weekend and she was very welcoming at the door after popping out of nowhere acting as if we were trying to interfere with her property not realizing that we were the guests. Not only that, at 9:30pm she makes a report to air bnb falsely accused us of breaking house rules intending to kick us out in the middle of the night. She tried to charge me $400 as damage to her tv knowing that it was already discolored and leaking ink. She claimed that we smashed her tv but little does she know we have proof of the state the tv was in when we arrived. The place was clean but had a musty and dusty odor to it. DON’T COME HERE!!!!"
16531782,1010179600151440962,2023-10-25,474203845,Kaitlin,"I was so glad to be able to stay with Liz one last time before my travel contract ended. Walkable distance from St. Peters, and a CVS and other restaurants nearby. It was very easy to check in and the place was so beautiful and clean. Liz was responsive to my texts. Loved it!"

Great location (just slightly away from downtown in a quiet residential area; but within 5 mins drive, you will be in the middle of the city). The unit is very charming and as exactly as described. Liz is super helpful when we needed to reach out. We would love to come back the next time we are in this part of upstate NY."

Very cozy bed might I add!<br/>I truly recommend!!"

16531782,1144212979685637444,2024-04-27,99571351,Lena,This spot was in such a lovely calm area with tons of open grass and clean streets. <br/>The space itself was so fun and quirky in its decorations—really enjoyed ourselves!
16531782,1145030562775867338,2024-04-28,132655692,Jennifer,Beautiful area and perfect for my husband and I for a night in Albany. Slept very well and felt extremely comfortable there.
16531782,1145709550288138701,2024-04-29,504818712,Charles,"Very affordable option in a nice area, but could use some updating and some deep cleaning."

16531782,1147899036328010560,2024-05-02,240112553,Chiara,casa molto carina e tenuta con molta cura. l'appartamento dedicato a noi era molto grande e spazioso. non abbiamo trovato aspetti negativi.<br/>non avevamo internet durante il ns viaggio quindi abbiamo apprezzato molto che Elizabeth ci abbia dato con largo anticipo tutte le informazioni necessarie per arrivare a casa sua.
16531782,1150044390038090192,2024-05-05,95775360,Amber,Great location!

16531782,1161637776147548042,2024-05-21,212848589,Aleta,"De deur klemde heel erg van de studio, waardoor je hem slecht open kreeg of op slot kreeg. <br/>De banken en stoelen waren zeer oncomfortabel.  De indeling was anders dan op de foto's. Studio is aan renovatie toe.<br/>Als de eettafel een kwart slag gedraaid en er 2 stoelen aangeschoven worden, kun je er samen eten.  Nu zaten we om de beurt aan tafel en naar de muur te staren.<br/>op de tafel lag de beschrijving om uit te checken;. Doe deuren op slot en leg sleutel on brievenbus of sleutelkluis.<br/>Toen we weggingen om 10.30 u was Elizabeth niet thuis. Dus netjes alles afgesloten en sleutel in kluisje. Onderweg kreeg ik een telefoontje van Elizabeth,  wat ik niet kon beantwoorden. Daarna bericht of we uit de kamer waren.<br/>Geen internet onderweg. Dus 's avonds een bericht gestuurd dat we ruim op rijd uitgecheckt hadden. Maar dat had ze ook kunnen zien aan de sleutel in het kluisje."
16531782,1163144362366795738,2024-05-23,560857546,Lindsey,Really nice spacious and well decorated room.
16531782,1163803276001830065,2024-05-24,118194726,Cheryl,"I have stayed at this airbnb once before last fall.  This is by far my favorite air bnb in <br/>the Albany area. Beside the bed, there is a couch and small<br/>table, TV, kitchenette, snacks and coffee.  The bed is very comfortable.  We walked to a Dunkin' Donuts and wonderful restaurant (605) on New Scotland Avenue. If this accommodation is available when I come to Albany, this is where I will stay."
16531782,1164601888447890723,2024-05-25,134008960,Misty,"I would totally stay again, only longer next time."
16531782,1165332420635882676,2024-05-26,418642375,Alex,"Elizabeth was friendly. The place was in a cute, older home and that carried through to the studio space. Since it was in an older home the bathroom was dated and probably in need of an update as the shower was grimy. The room did not have AC so a box fan was placed in an open window allowing bugs to get in which I found throughout the studio. I was able to close the window and kept the multiple fans going through the night to keep me cool. It was a good space for a quick one night stay for the price."
16531782,1166702112588380996,2024-05-28,38585985,Corrine,Loved Liz’s place. Very quaint. Exactly as described.  Will stay there again!

16531782,1170413323031161283,2024-06-02,14602676,Brian,"Overall nice studio apartment.  I just needed a place to sleep and this was exactly what I needed.  The decor made it feel like it was some old Victorian place.  I appreciated the furniture -- small table and chairs for eating, couch and armchair alongside a coffee table."
16531782,1173234564647536754,2024-06-06,368663510,Halley,Enjoyed staying here! Quiet place and felt right at home. We got in incredibly late due to flights and she accommodated this for us! Would recommend anytime!

16531782,1181995835790063369,2024-06-18,127182913,Christophe,"Got there late so we could not meet our hostess. But very pleasant messages were left by Elysabeth to encourage us to use the pool and enjoy the garden, which we did and it was lovely."
16531782,1184130396321828263,2024-06-21,301263904,Janice,"Liz was very easy to reach, gave clear check in instructions and the room was very quaint and clean. The bed was also very comfortable!  We enjoyed our stay at this Air BNB."

16531782,1185549674993642731,2024-06-23,163228267,L. A.,"Liz's Victorian property is located on a quiet street in an upscale neighborhood, conveniently located about midpoint between the university and downtown. The property has all the amenities, and is surrounded by beautiful gardens, a gazebo, and pool. We have recently enjoyed our second stay with Liz and look forward to the next time."
16531782,1187071233566958180,2024-06-25,211580527,Becky,We really enjoyed the decor of the room. It fit well with the style of home

16531782,1212455540137330594,2024-07-30,9650524,Gaynor,Had a fab night here on our way to Montreal to see relatives. Cosy quirky and comfortable we slept really well after what had been a very long travelling day! Easy walking distance of some nice restaurants and we went to the Tipsy Moose which was great fun and Chris really looked after us there.  Would definitely stay here again 😊

16531782,1218930775070006776,2024-08-08,2298169,Eamonn,Lovely place to stay in the Albany area and a great host. Thoroughly recommend. Thanks!
16531782,1219605564577980350,2024-08-09,436535541,John,"Perfect stay, 0 complaints. Really cool decor too"
16531782,1220387037774159110,2024-08-10,45434257,Emily,"A clean and well stocked suite. Quiet, walkable neighborhood with access to main roads. Bonus, I hadn’t realized there was pool when we booked. Negatives: two safety concerns 1) there were multiple airbnbs in the unit, all of which seemed to have their keys in one lock box. Anyone could have let themselves into our suite prior to our arrival. Especially since the person before us hadn’t re-locked the lock box. 2) our suite didn’t have a doorknob. Just a hole in the door with a piece of paper taped over it. There was a deadbolt, but it still felt uncomfortable."
16531782,1221794112605536474,2024-08-12,350230429,Stephanie,A very private and comfortable space. We were surprised by the outside garden and pool area.
16531782,1223267706463438223,2024-08-14,462750944,Barbara,"This blue studio is adorable. It has a full size fridge. A mini kitchen with sink, double hot plate burner, all the pots/pans/ utensils and plates you could need. Microwave. There was more but i can not remember. The bed was comfortable not hard or soft. It felt like the perfect mini apartment. I wish i could rent this room out permanently."
16531782,1224777005243032621,2024-08-16,112745798,Alessandro,Le indicazioni fornite da Elizabeth per trovare l'appartamento sono state molto utili. Il self check-in da libertà assoluta per l'arrivo. Angolo cucina molto fornito ed ideale per prepararsi pasti veloci. Migliorabile la pulizia generale dell'appartamento e necessarie alcune piccole manutenzioni.
16531782,1225442908429685043,2024-08-17,387135290,Caitlin,"Such a beautiful, peaceful space. Highly recommend!"
16531782,1227560660049528470,2024-08-20,66601925,Aloys,"Super étape sur notre route pour Montréal.<br/>Excellente communication avec l'hôte, charmante et accueillante<br/>Le studio décoré de façon rétro et atypique disposait de tout ce que l'on peut attendre avec une mention spéciale pour la literie"
16531782,1228399629054610944,2024-08-21,116400733,Christina,"When I checked in, the lock seemed a little sketchy to get in and out. The place didn’t feel very clean. There’s a pool and the host left a note in the room saying feel free to use it. When I went to check it out, I saw a dead mouse in the pool.<br/>After that, I left and told the host I’d like to cancel my stay. She did not respond so I called Airbnb support to get a refund. <br/>The host eventually got back to me saying they just changed the locks and are fine and the dead creature was a chipmunk…. I have photographic evidence of a mouse, however, she completely dismissed my concern and reasons for not feeling comfortable. <br/>She later sent me a long and very rude message verbally attacking me and saying I overreacted. So, not a great host…."
16531782,1229844721290293240,2024-08-23,586515564,Osa,This place was very pretty. Me and my friend stayed here and it was a very comfy cozy place. The backyard is beautiful!!
16531782,1232724382267812572,2024-08-27,29819540,Logan,great spot!
16531782,1233445867448144656,2024-08-28,216247270,Vesna,"The house was in a beautiful, peaceful, green area, wonderfully decorated and very clean. We never got to meet Elizabeth, but she was very helpful over the phone letting us leave our bags after check-out."
17238066,146783272,2017-04-23,2713175,Vivien,"Adam was an excellent host. He was kind and considerate. I came to Albany for a hiking trip, and he even packed me a to-go lunch for my hike. Felt like home away from home!"
17238066,147596579,2017-04-27,13021635,Rocky,Adam is such a wonderful host. So accommodating to whatever it is you might need. The food was excellent and you wont find a friendlier guy. Meeting people like him make my airbnb experiences much more valuable. Thanks again!
17238066,149718296,2017-05-05,29597055,Zaki,Adam is a great host. Picking me up from the station at midnight was a life saver and he even dropped me off at my school in the morning. I wish him all the best.
17238066,152648278,2017-05-17,28230591,Naveen,"Adam is an excellent host and ready to help at any time. Arrived late and left early, he was kind enough to prepare takeaway boxes on my way out. Very nice place to stay. Clean and comfortable. Great location. The food is extremely good. Best hosting anywhere."
17238066,153045783,2017-05-19,113421683,Andrew,Adam is a great host.<br/>Make sure you arrive hungry! 
17238066,153284866,2017-05-20,3244290,Jordan,I couldn't imagine a better value. really nice vibe.
17238066,153693240,2017-05-21,1194982,Paula,"I appreciated Adam's generosity in picking me up and dropping me off at the Amtrak station, despite a last-minute change in my schedule. I was also thankful for the warm breakfast and lunch to go that he prepared. The room where I slept was small but adequate, with red walls and eccentric decoration. Fresh towels were tightly wrapped in plastic. The shared bathroom is down the hall. Adam visibly cares for his guests, as his meals and many reviews attest; however, the accommodations and cafe have the vibe more of an eclectic budget hostel with a few rough edges than a cozy home stay. "
17238066,155721648,2017-05-28,87626491,Indra,Adam is the most amazing host  I' e had. The food is delicious and his hospitality in unmatchable. Dwfinetely a great place to stay!
17238066,157114711,2017-06-02,55387106,Kelena,Great food! Very hospitable host and really cares about providing the best experience possible to his guests!!
17238066,163097558,2017-06-23,113521,Ja,"This reservation was for my son, who was undertaking an internship at the State Capitol.  Adam was so gracious and welcoming and made sure that my son was comfortable and well cared for.  I would get calls from my son telling me how wonderful the experience was, especially the amazing food.  He will be back for the rest of the summer and is so excited.  I am truly thankful to have found Adam's place."
17238066,163950213,2017-06-25,2688473,King,"Fantastic value, delightful stay. As I think Adam says in the description, it's not a luxurious new swanky place. It feels like hostel living, in a good way. It's a charming old flat above a cafe, where you can enjoy the meals Adam prepares for you, according to your wishes. He couldn't be a more accommodating, gracious, welcoming host. I'm not in this part of the country very often, but if I ever am again, I'll hope there's space here. "
17238066,164239267,2017-06-26,797914,New,"Adam's place is probably the best Airbnb I've stayed at. He is incredibly welcoming and generous. Not only did he pick me up from the bus station, he also gave me a ride across town for an interview. He makes individual meals for each of his guests (depending on their gluten, fat, vegan, ect. preferences). His building has a cafe on the first floor where he prepares the meals. The place has a bohemian/international feel of a hostel. Even when I said that it was unnecessary for him to make me lunch because I wasn't staying for very long, he made me a brown bag lunch to go. I would have loved to stay another night but unfortunately, the place was booked, and now you know why. Thanks Adam, you are an amazing host. "
17238066,165358221,2017-07-01,113521,Ja,Another great stay with Adam!  Excellent food included and even a ride to the train station!
17238066,167699886,2017-07-07,137703373,Ernie,That was a really good experience
17238066,168939822,2017-07-10,43283456,Stephen,"Adam is very friendly and caring fellow who not only provides a clean place to stay bit also serves healthy and tasty food.  I would recommend this place to others who are not looking for a fancy place to stay, just a real friendly place.  Adam is very helpful and enjoys providing for his guests!"
17238066,171671002,2017-07-18,5578321,Clar,Great location and 3 free meals a day. Awesome host. <br/>Adam even did my laundry and drove me to the airport. <br/>Highly recommended. 
17238066,172664591,2017-07-21,66817305,James,Adam is a great host and I will always choose Adam over any 5 star hotel!
17238066,173599864,2017-07-23,34288619,Jack,"Adam is a great, and very friendly host. His airbnb is clean, tidy, and offers many amenities. I felt very confortable and well fed. Private parking was a great addition."
17238066,174930865,2017-07-27,51356602,Iris,"Adam is the best host ever! He  picked me up at the airport, took me to my bar exam site and back, made me three meals a day. He relieved all my worries about how to travel to the right exam place on time and how to feed myself, so I could focus on my studies. I enjoy talking to him and I love every meal and dessert he made. I will come back again!"
17238066,175783203,2017-07-29,113521,Ja,Adam is a great and caring guy.  A wonderful host who we highly recommend.
17238066,178979360,2017-08-06,135435992,Cameron,"Loved staying at adam's place! The room was cozy and perfect, the meals were great, and he was very nice. Super undervalued in my brief experience doing airbnb"
17238066,179874886,2017-08-08,129125277,Laëtitia,"Adam est généreux, altruiste et souriant, que demander de plus ? "
17238066,180900674,2017-08-11,133045972,Hongxiang,"Adam is a doctor, he knows a lot of medical knowledge and how to make health food. His food is very delicious. He is a very kindhearted man. Hope to here again."
17238066,219891188,2017-12-19,142556233,Bradford,"Thanks for Adam's hospitality. I feel at home during the four-month stay. Adam's room is clean and beautiful with styllish decoration. You can have access to convenient transportation here, too. And the best thing is his delicous dinner because you won't forget it easily once you have a try."
17238066,220729055,2017-12-23,108307314,Lena,Adam was very welcoming and generous. The food was delicious and he went out of his way to take me to the airport for a very early flight. I'd stay there again!
17238066,349523554,2018-11-17,203320080,Victor,"Was in town for a brief stay, for the price was a great find.<br/>Location - Suburban town, so Uber/Lyft are best bets for getting around, probably not an area that you would wander at night, but everything in Albany is roughly 10-15m away from each other.<br/>Price - great price, breakfast included - Adam made me a crepe each morning, with tea and a small brownie. He texted me a picture in the morning.<br/>Host extremely responsive.<br/>What's Included: Bed, 2 pillows, bed sheets, room was sufficiently warmed with a heateing unit in the room, Desk, office chair, regular chair, Closet w/ Hangers, Bath towel and Face towel<br/>2 restrooms upstairs - 1 just w/ toilet, 1 w/ toilet and standing shower<br/>Ambience - location is a room w/ private lock on door and resident entrance from the back of the Cafe. Room is a decent size with 2 lights, 2 electrical outlets on either side of the room (1 right above bed, 1 by the desk)<br/>1 window w/ blinds facing a brick wall<br/>Room is located upstairs, there is a small kitchen with stove top, oven, microwave and sink.<br/>Room has a Hardwood floor with carpet<br/>Older home setting, but perfect for a traveler on a budget."
17238066,353587478,2018-11-28,28230591,Naveen,"Adam's place is my favorite place to stay in the Albany region. The food and the house are perfect. The apartment is clean, warm and cozy with many nice personal touches. The food is organic, tasty and quite healthy. Fully recommend. Adam is a perfect host and is very friendly."
17238066,354354032,2018-12-01,167006617,Nachiket,"Great experience, great hospitality and breakfast."
17238066,360457994,2018-12-20,79646229,Gwen,This was definitely a unique experience! Adam made me a very delicious breakfast both mornings. I think this would be a great place to rent with a friend or relative in the other bedroom. The bed was warm and I slept like a rock! :)
17238066,447430839,2019-05-03,101779119,Yifan,Good location and great hospitality !

17238066,456790970,2019-05-22,107808077,Jonathan,"Adam’s place had the feel the hostels I’ve traveled to abroad. I enjoyed my time at his air B&b. It’s a great place, worth the value. Adam will make you breakfast every morning and offers you organic food (Lunch and dinner) at a fraction of the cost you’d pay anywhere else."
17238066,458972630,2019-05-26,28230591,Naveen,Adam is the best host I have stayed with. Food is amazing and he is very helpful with requests. Enjoyed the place and food. Fully recommend to anyone.
17238066,515924704,2019-08-23,261231274,Susan,Great value for traveller or student. Lives up to its description. Be sure to check if the room has A/C for summer.
17238066,672108965,2020-10-07,1285202,Meerim,"Adam was great-very easy to communicate with, available 24/7. He also was kind enough to drive me to a nearby town. Thank you"
17238066,722586092,2021-01-07,227859955,Gabriel,"Great experience! The host is an intellectual doctor who speaks in multiple languages. There's a PRIVATE restaurant on the first floor, free breakfast every morning that will be a surprise! A menu in your room with eclectic foods, some French, some Turkish, all unique. Order and get your food delivered right to your room! There is a kitchen if you prefer to make your own meal.<br/>But, this is not your typical Airbnb. It's a hostel. The house is rustic. Surfaces are painted over. You get a private room and shared bathroom. Clean bed. Guests should be courteous to each other and clean up after themselves in shared spaces, always. The cost to stay is cheap. You are not paying for a maid. It's a different experience than what you're used to. But stay affordably, ask a little about culture, and enjoy the food!"
17238066,725513773,2021-01-19,322903582,Eric,I had a bit of a personal issue that came up the day of my trip to Adam's place and I was going to miss my expected window of arrival by nearly 8 hours. Adam was understanding of my situation and stayed up late just to let me in at night. Adam also made me a sausage egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast on my way out. This man is a good man and treats his travelers as good friends.
17238066,726470151,2021-01-24,148804703,Yi,Adam was very professional and his place is exactly as described. Will stay here again.
17238066,729047651,2021-02-05,182493475,Lucas,Expect great hospitality and great conversation. Awesome guy very helpful. The meals are amazing. Can't wait to stay again.
17238066,730768139,2021-02-13,19926898,Austin,I stayed at Adam’s place briefly for one night and I had a good night of sleep! Adam was kind and the location was close to downtown with convient public transportation too!

17238066,746596825,2021-04-07,106412780,Ariel,"Adam was an incredible host. Not only did he pick me up from the train station, but he got out of the car and was waiting in the train station when I arrived. <br/>He serves you food but also gave me snacks so I wouldn’t have to go out and buy them. <br/>Very kind and hospitable!! <br/>Definitely recommend!!"

17238066,394118112436208056,2021-06-27,7184840,Jeevan,I had a smooth and comfortable stay at Adam. I kinda had an idea of the location already. Adam reassured me regarding the street parking. Check-in was smooth. Plenty of coffee was available and I needed access to printer that Adam provided gladly. He allowed me to hang out for a couple of hours extra at his Cafe downstairs as well. The place is simple and value for money. Its what I had wanted for a night's sleep and it worked out perfectly for me. Wonderful and friendly host.
17238066,403527567137998608,2021-07-10,218001714,Jihyun,"It's a very comfortable place to stay!<br/>He really helped me stay comfortable!

17238066,405049728301271489,2021-07-12,404852644,Errico,Adams a great host. I work night shift and he realize that I wasn’t much for breakfast after working so it didn’t make me breakfast instead he’s made me a dinner to take to work with me me. Great guy
17238066,406461235918582697,2021-07-14,11575642,Tom,Good value for the price.
17238066,408662744736779692,2021-07-17,204603231,Mike,The room was exactly as expected.

17238066,431050236750513979,2021-08-17,262648672,Dennis,This place was a fantastic value if your on a budget.  The owner is extremely nice and even did my laundry. Breakfast is also available.  Please read the description carefully.  The neighborhood is a little rundown but very close to large supermarket and right on the main bus line.  <br/>Thanks for everything Adam!!
17238066,438389538400269268,2021-08-27,32026607,Cindy,"As described, Adam is a very welcoming and warm host. He was waiting for me when I arrived which made me feel comfortable right away, and he sent me off with a delicious and generous breakfast sandwich to go. Adam also communicated quickly and clearly which really helps. The room was exactly as described and the single bed was very comfortable, and there were thoughtful touches in the room. The fan keeps the room quite comfortable even in the heat wave. My only wish for improvement would be that the common areas, bathrooms, kitchen counters, were cleaner. Adam does a great job with the description. Thanks Adam!"
17238066,439052742707139414,2021-08-28,145373435,David,great host
17238066,444080984269932284,2021-09-04,419619730,Melissa,"Adam is completely upfront in the listing and in private messages prior to booking about what kind of accommodation you'll be paying for. It is truly a hostel. Cleanliness can sometimes be dependent on other guests so be courteous. <br/>I had no issue parking directly in front at any time of day. The neighborhood isn't that bad. Walking distance to Shoprite. <br/>Adam graciously made me a packed breakfast at 6am so I could be at work by 7am. I looked forward to the little surprise extras he would include. Also, if I needed something printed, he had no problem letting me use his computer to print something out. <br/>All of it was much appreciated."
17238066,447013791283459305,2021-09-08,215610026,Christine,My go-to place when I’m visiting Albany. Thanks Adam for the vegan breakfast & delicious coffee!

Room was small but clean and comfortable. It was exactly what he described. Not a 5 star hotel, but that wasn't what I paid for. :-)"
17238066,478896129738147275,2021-10-22,216459526,Christina,Adam gives you a heads up of his place before he confirms your booking which is great. What you see is what you get. Had no problem finding parking right in front of his place.  His free breakfast was really nice
17238066,480336950397786962,2021-10-24,175477940,Edward,"Read the description carefully. This is not a five-star accommodation.

Definitely read the description because this is not somewhere to stay if you are fussy about cleanliness, etc. But very good value and a very nice host - I would stay here if I came to Albany again."
17238066,732655187410853974,2022-10-07,104713393,Theja,Great price for a solo traveler on a quick trip. Didn’t miss the AC.

17514620,137460481,2017-03-15,94540399,Tatiana,"Nick and Liz's place is comfortable and welcoming. Nick communicated well before and during my stay, check-in was a snap, and the house had everything I needed -- microwave, teapot, fridge, good wifi, hot water with good pressure. The other guest I met was welcoming and friendly. Everything was very clean. The dog, Bella, is energetic and affectionate. One thing I would pass on -- and it's a delicate matter and a structural characteristic of the house, not anyone's fault -- is that the stairwell going up to the bedrooms is very, very narrow. I am a thin person and handled it fine, but if I were an obese person I might not have been able to fit in that staircase. "

17514620,144359081,2017-04-15,100545977,Anna,"Cozy is the perfect word to describe the house and the room we stayed in. Although we never met Nick & Liz, they seemed to be more than happy to tend to any needs we may have. We had a smaller room but it had all the essentials and it was more than satisfactory. We had a great stay and are definitely looking to check out their other rooms in the future!"

17514620,204119057,2017-10-16,119050615,Stephanie,"Nic's place is conveniently located for anyone working or studying at the medical school, law school, pharmacy school or U Albany. It is also within walking distance of many restaurants and other resources, like the public library and city parks. While the neighborhood could be infrequently noisy, I never felt unsafe. I lucked out with amazing housemates in the other rooms, and, of course, Nic was also available for any questions or needs."

Parking available at the apartment. All amenities available and hosts very helpful. Many people stay at the same time so it’s a nice environment to spend a month.
17514620,331787380,2018-10-03,204151053,Adam,"This was a lovely place to stay. The living room and kitchen were clean and the kitchen was well equipped. Bathroom was very clean. we had a slight issue with the TV but the host responded really quickly which was great so it was sorted. Due to the air con unit, there is a slight draft and noise at night  in the room but I don't think that can be helped.  Other than that it was a fantastic place to stay and we would stay again!"

17514620,355987693,2018-12-06,59459037,Vittorio,"Chad is a great, welcoming host. He makes you feel home and is always there when you report some little problem to him. He will go to great lenghts for you to be comfortable.<br/>The house is in a great position and the area is quiet. The apt has a warm and cozy living room which is absolutely lovely, you wouldn't even say it belogs to an airbnb house!! Only negative aspect is that the closest furnished sumermarket is ten minutes one should walk with bags from the shopping but that is not too much of a problem since buses pass on the road.<br/>I strongly recommend the host and the place!"

At first thought me and my cousin would run into space sharing issues since there are 3 other roommates but barely saw them and when we did they were all very friendly. Definitely recommend!

17514620,923981840964971349,2023-06-28,31418311,John B,"A 3-star place. Some good features, but the bed was bad enough that I would not recommend staying here.<br/>The good: Price was right, location was close to the hospital (easy 10 minute walk), Chad was responsive to problems in the house, intelligently designed space for multiple guests to co-exist peacefully. The room is quite small, but it's manageable.<br/>The bad: I would describe the bed as a ""soft taco."" It felt like a soft foam pad with a trench down the middle. My wife and I rolled into one another all night long. I did not get a single good night of sleep in the 10 nights I spent here. We were both dying to leave after 3 nights."

18341426,269610847,2018-05-27,31847756,Paul,"Piotr was an excellent host and dealt with the 2 very small issues we had very quickly making the stay a great experience.<br/>The neighbourhood is very quiet but at the same time very close to shops, bars and restaurants so couldn't ask for anymore from the location.<br/>The house is suitable for up to 6 people although when we were there the seating was limited but this was fine for us as there were only 3 people staying. I do however know that his has been resolved for future guests as an additional couch was added on the day we were leaving.<br/>Would definitely book this place again or others owned in the area by Piotr."
18341426,323451020,2018-09-15,72075829,Anna,"My parents and I had a wonderful and memorable time staying at three of Piotr's places this year. This is the second year my parents stayed at Piotr's place for about three months. We appreciate Piotr's effort in flexibly scheduling throughout our stay because my parents were in Europe for 3 weeks in between their stay at Albany. We like the homey design of each home. Every home is five-star clean and has everything we needed as a family. My parents and I enjoyed having meals together every day. We often sat outside for a chat while appreciating the flowers and plants of the homes and listening to bird chirping and singing. I often bought coffee for my dad from the nearby coffee shop in the morning. Taking a walk after dinner with my mom around the church close by or on campus was my favorite activity of the day. Neighbors are very friendly and have great sense of humor. They made my parents who don't speak English feel very welcomed. One neighbor said for over 40 years he's been having his house,  this area has been very safe.<br/>Thank you Piotr, our best wishes to you on your business."
18341426,325384623,2018-09-19,82635649,Suchi,It was a great stay. There are fast food restaurants at walking distance which was good.

It is a comfortable and VERY clean house with all anyone needs for an enjoyable stay.  WIFI worked perfectly, tv's large with cable.  Everything is very updated, particularly the bathroom and kitchen. The location is handy to everything, close to highways yet very quiet.  I can recommend the house and would not hesitate to return when we next travel to Albany."

The bathroom had a hair dryer, cotton and cleaner for make up removal, and great shampoo and conditioner options. The kitchen had a beautiful layout, splendid arrangement of tea and coffee, and wonderful/new appliances. The bedrooms were extremely clean and had comfortable mattresses, trendy and new furniture, great pillows, and charging ports next to the beds- The guest room had a TV and desk. My father who was staying with us really enjoyed the front room with the TV and music. It was great to have a washer and dryer too so we could dry some clothes after a rainy day. <br/>Peter was quick to respond and his thoughtful outreach to make sure we arrived safely after driving 16 hours through the snow for a funeral was greatly appreciated. <br/>Keypad entry and covered carport!!<br/>I have recommended his home to my brother and sister-in-law and I’m sure we will be staying again!

Everything was clean and decorated in an esthetically pleasing manner. He has so many unique gadgets in the home that truly make you want to replicate them in your own home. I really loved the spa room, Sonos speaker system, and automatic height adjusting computer desk. Peter was very attentive, and if I needed anything, it was taken care of immediately. I would highly recommend staying here, and if I could give more than a five star rating,  I would give him a 10!"

I came to visit Albany for residency interviews and found Ed’s place to be close by.  Their place is beautiful and clean.  I was provided fresh towels and linen.  The bed was comfortable, much more than my own bed!  Ed and Anne welcomed me and my friend who was briefly visiting.  I would definitely stay with them again!"
19527043,359683494,2018-12-17,211347554,Andrew,Everything was great! Would definitely recommend

19527043,426574656,2019-03-21,69108342,Fiona,"Ed's place was warm, comfortable and convenient. The master bedroom is large, spotlessly clean, and beautifully decorated in a victorian style. The bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in an airbnb. The bathroom is huge and spotlessly clean. The towels and sheets are good quality. There is a large TV with every imaginable streaming service and live TV. The location is very convenient to the local colleges and hospitals. There are a few good restaurants within walking distance. I ate at Oyster and Ale and can highly recommend it. I didn't use the kitchen, but was able to keep a few things in the fridge."
19527043,428077332,2019-03-24,129736105,Dayna,"Had a great stay! Ed was more than welcoming. Our room was a large space, nice and clean and close to where we needed to be! Had everything we needed and the bed was extremely comfortable. We would definitely stay here again :)"
19527043,447971165,2019-05-04,4354453,Mindy,"Ed’s home is beautiful. Parking is easy. My boyfriend and I obtained a spot right outside. It’s only a few minutes by care from major spots l, like lark street or downtown Albany.  Ed was a great and responsive host. The room was very huge and the bed was comfortable. Also, it was great having a private full bathroom."
19527043,455291376,2019-05-19,250712691,Mia,"quickly respond, very friendly host."
19527043,456404105,2019-05-21,107978719,Mark,We had a fantastic stay at Ed’s place in Albany. It’s a great location in a very pleasant neighbourhood.
19527043,457205206,2019-05-23,134439150,Katarina,We had a wonderful stay! Everything exceeded expectation. The bedroom was comfortable and had everything necessary for a long or short stay. The private bathroom was large and clean. The hospitality was excellent as well. We would definitely stay again.
19527043,457660073,2019-05-24,262052321,Crystal,"The bedroom wasnt as bad as the rest of the house, which is good because that is where your time is mostly spent when there. However there was quite the lingering smell of dog which did transfer to our clothing. The tub and sink could have been cleaner, but not completely disgusting.  They did provide good toilet paper, towels, toothpaste hand soap and shampoo. The kitchen was offered to be used, however the table was full of personal stuff and had nowhere to sit.  We were also allowed to use fridge, but it looked like a science experiment was growing in there. It also seems to be on a main drag which makes it super convenient...but also noisy.  I only stayed the one night, it was about 68⁰ outside, and the room was so hot.  There was no thermostat to control the temperature and no fan.   There was only 1 spot to plug stuff into in the bedroom...it was a power strip plugged into an extension cord, im pretty sure thats a fire hazard. The porch steps seems to be slanted toward the street, almost like it was sinking...not sure entirely what was going on but it was a wierd feeling walking the steps.  The path that leads from the sidewalk up to the house has a few spots and missing bricks that could be tripping hazards.  There is also a healthy amount of mold above the window that is on the staircase leading to your room.  It is being poorly hidden by a curtain.  There is an upper porch off the room which would have been wonderful if there were a few chairs and a small table to utilize the space. Ed and his wife are super nice, friendly and helpful. For the most part the room is as pictured. I think the owner could benefit greatly from a few small changes/additions; air freshener, fans, if they still would like to offer guests a fridge and coffee pot..put them in the room instead of the kitchen.  All in all it did what it was supposed to, just be a place to stay a night, so from that point of view it was totally worth the $50. I would highly suggest not paying more then that and if your staying more then 1 night you're better off in a hotel."
19527043,458849007,2019-05-26,92116735,Cassie,"Great location (15 min walk to downtown), plenty of street parking, quiet neighborhood. Large clean space with attached bathroom and chairs. Hosts were very responsive."
19527043,460622797,2019-05-29,250951702,Sarah,A beautiful home and lovely spacious room.  Beautiful porch.  A warm welcome.  I had a lovely walk through the park to get great coffee and then a nice walk to the amazing State library and museum.  A great stay!  Thanks Ed.
19527043,461400335,2019-05-31,75418595,Rebecca,"Thanks for everything Ed! The place was so cute to stay in. Very clean and true to the victorian style, makes you feel like a princess!"
19527043,497443316,2019-07-28,249661101,Nell,"I stayed with Ed and Ann for two months during a summer internship and their place was a great find - it's very clean, safe, cozy and conveniently located. I could use the kitchen and they added a mini fridge to the room not long after I arrived, which was super helpful. Plus their two dogs are so cute!"

The room was immaculately clean. I loved that the sheets smelled fresh out of the wash! <br/>Ed was very responsive and hospitable. He recommended this amazing breakfast place close by that we went both days we were there. The house is located close to the city center and was perfect for us!
19527043,507472564,2019-08-11,44484239,Paul,"Perfect stay at Ed’s house. A beautyfull place near downtown Albany. Contact with Ed was perfect, quick reactions. We had room no1 on the first floor.

Ed was very welcoming and made us feel instantly at home.  The room was immaculate, well appointed and very relaxing.  We loved the front porch.   I highly recommend Ed’s place and plan to return there myself ."
19527043,386924065649636576,2021-06-17,1000194,Claire,Always a comfortable and welcoming stay. Hosts are friendly and make you feel at home in this house from another time. Comfortable bed and the rooms are thoughtfully appointed.  Convenient location and on street parking- check the parking signs  for street cleaning.
19527043,394791760380796307,2021-06-28,5529842,Mason,"I cannot say enough good things about our stay here. The house is ginormous and absolutely beautiful. Our room had it's own AC that worked perfectly, the hosts are home but have completely separate living quarters that you never even see.....even if your a wanderer like me. One of the most clean and comfortable stays I've had in a very very long time. The Pictures just don't do this place justice. Ed and his wife made us feel like we were just visiting family.<br/>If you haven't stayed in a room instead of a whole place before, this is experice to assure you that rooms on air bnb are fantasic. <br/>I'd rent the room long term and live in the house if I lived in town. <br/>Thank you for being such fantastic people!"
19527043,398431534547322259,2021-07-03,14677599,Lee,"This is a beautiful suite in a grand old house across from a park.  The bed was comfortable, and the sitting area (two comfortable chairs, large screen TV and a fireplace) really made the suite feel like home.  It was a nice mix of old and new: classic tiles in the bathroom, with a new shower head (good temperature and pressure) and plenty of counter space and drawers, as needed.  Ed was also super accommodating and flexible. Highly recommended."

Ed's wife Anne was home when we were there, and very helpful and accommodating, as we were using the kitchen somewhat and looking for local suggestions.  The house was near a college, so there were some good eating places a 6 minute walk away, and it was also a great location to walk through beautiful Washington Park to the downtown area, including Empire Plaza.  We'd love to stay there again!"

The house is so nice and we loved the large bedroom with sitting area. The house was clean, quiet and warm. It is located beside a park near the medical school. It is not far from some poorer neighborhoods, which owe drove through, but don't despair - it is in a very nice area! This is a big beautiful old home with thick carpet and curving stairs - dreamy!"

It is an older home but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Suggestion would be a hair dryer and a lighter blanket option  for those who might find the room warm.

19527043,1194305758383332996,2024-07-05,125830480,Sheila,"Ed and Anne’s home is simply exceptional. Vast, immaculately clean, tastefully antique chic in decor, a guest could ask for no more. In addition, it offers privacy, calmness, and multiple spaces to relax both indoors and outdoors. Ed and Anne are incredibly generous hosts who accommodated a few of my  requests and who responded to inquiries immediately. Moreover, the location can’t be beat. Whether one wants fine or casual dining, to watch an independent film, visit local attractions such as the Albany State Museum or the beautiful Empire plaza, all is within both walking distance and easily accessible by a well organized, intuitive bus system. I am already looking forward to revisiting my Albany Oasis. Thank you for being such superlative hosts, Ed and Anne!"

19571496,274553698,2018-06-09,38654550,Virginia,Good location with offstreet parking. Listing is for a basement room that has separate entry into the house. The room is right under the kitchen so you can sometimes hear the kitchen noises and movement. The second bed is a pullout couch and you will likely need to request bedding for it. The place felt secure. Gives a hostel vibe with shared kitchen and bathroom with 2-3 other renters.
19571496,313602846,2018-08-25,81179182,Feng-Yuan,Best experience with Airbnb. Will definitely recommend to friends if visiting Albany.
19571496,405182956,2019-01-26,106468095,Giulio Fernando,"The house was really comfy!<br/>It's a common wood house in Albany with all the basics needed for a comfort living.<br/>It's big and the bed is reaaaaaaally comfortable. The couch is also comfortable but not as much as the bed haha. But it was no problem sleeping on the couch, also!<br/>There will be more people in the house, so you're going to meet new people from other places, too! The people we met were amazing and it was really fun talking to them. There's just one bathroom (idk if there are more upstairs).<br/>It is possible to hear the noises of the steps upstairs, but people will take off their shoes when in the house, thus the sound is decreased. Bring flip flops!<br/>The amenities (toilet paper, towel, blankets, etc.) were clean and good!<br/>One really good point is that Chad is always up to helping when needed. I needed help from him late at night and he responded within seconds to my messages. <br/>The house's location is perfect! There's everything near: stores, bus stops, pubs..."
19571496,418223246,2019-03-01,5092773,Susana,"I stayed at chad's studio for several days whilst taking the NY bar and it's definitely a good option to stay quality/pice. It's a basic and simple studio, it's clean, the bed is super comfy, it has a large desk which is great for studying and the location is good! The kitchen is well equipped too. There is a deli/ small superette with the basics right in front of the house. The best thing is that Chas is really responsive and helpful and easy to communicate with. I spent the day revising in the main room of the studio where the desk is and the downside is that It gets quite cold. I think in spring or summer-time itd be perfect! The studio is downstairs and it's the coldest part of the house although it was warm upstairs in the kitchen, bathroom, living room...etc... It's true that I come from a warm place and am not used to Albany's cold temperatures in winter!! I told Chad about it and he brought me a small electric stove I could use in addition to the one there was in the bedroom. It was much better !! If you leave the electric heater in the bedroom on all day or during the night it's very strong, works well and it gets pretty warm. Hope it helps! Thanks Chad!!!"
19571496,500761668,2019-08-02,27575314,Eliane,My son stayed at Chad’s place for 2 months during his bar prep. The location was great to get to campus and Chad and Kellie were very helpful and responsive hosts. Highly recommend this place!

19571496,561477761,2019-11-09,191429307,Rumpel,컬리지 옆에 있어서 밤새 운영하는 가게들이 가까이 있어요. 집 주인은 다른 도시에 살아서 청소할 때만 집에 오는데 집의 청결 상태에 예민한 편이에요. 집이 더러우면 청소하고 나서 좀 치우라고 게스트한테 메세지 보내더라구요. 그리고 누가 어지렀는지 잘 몰라서 엄한 사람한테 화내고 사과 안 하기도 하구요. 하여간 난방비 때문에 난방 온도 많이 못 높여서 겨울에 지내기는 좀 추울 거 같지만. 호스트만 빼면 장기 투숙하는 데 괜찮은 집이에요.
19571496,587051271,2020-01-02,296552050,Mary,This is an excellent value place in great location. Chad and Kellie are top hosts.  Even though you are sharing space they keep it under control. Will go back.

19571496,762568002,2021-05-25,377328130,Mario,I stayed at Chad’s place for 5 months. The house is located next to the bus stops and the position is really good. Chad and Kellie are super nice and they are always there in case you need some help. <br/>Recommend!
19571496,434660197695906439,2021-08-22,385367239,Katie,"Hope you like bugs. I stayed in the basement studio and had problems with spiders, house centipedes, worms, and unidentified small white bugs. Also, the staircase is a lot smaller than I imagined and don’t recommend using it if you have difficulty with stairs. There is another entrance to the basement, but there was so many spider webs and mosquitoes that it was not usable.<br/>It is clear the pictures are either old or they hid things in their picture of the place. There are multiple water spots on the ceilings of which would get worse with rain, the bath is full of mildew, and the back porch area is unkept (looks nothing like the pictures).<br/>I hade no problems with the other guests - they were all very lovely! The kitchen has pots and pans, utensils, left over containers, and pantry storage! Never had a problem with this area. The washer and dryer are very nice as well!"
19571496,708705432966554184,2022-09-04,206953018,Evan,"I stayed in this Airbnb for a year while completing an internship at Albany Med. The basement is a very comfortable, private space. Plenty of space if working remotely. Chad and Kellie were great hosts; they were very responsive, often replying within minutes, the few times issues around the house came up. They also provided a lot of basic commodities (e.g., toilet paper, paper towels) throughout my entire stay. The house is walking distance to many restaurants, Washington park, and hospitals (AMC, VA hospital, CDPC). Although street parking is required for the house, I rarely had any difficulty finding space to park. I would definitely stay here again!"

19571496,755852399159502984,2022-11-08,8012809,Philine,"I enjoyed my stay at Kellie & Chad's place. They are very responsive and were able to make quick fixes for small things that came up during my stay. Very nice people! The house was very clean and the other guests respectful and quiet. However, I am a light sleeper, so I did get woken up a couple of times because the bedroom is in a basement meaning  you will naturally hear noises from the kitchen/bathroom. Location was nice for my meetings at the downtown SUNY campus (bus/walking), though I did not feel comfortable at night walking alone (taking uber is fine). The provided workspace is awesome, super big desk and comfortable chair."
19571496,764362534695794119,2022-11-20,471468929,Megan,"Absolutely amazing host, will never stay anywhere else if I need an Airbnb in Albany or Troy. Really cares about the people staying with him and goes above and beyond to take care of them"

Shared bathroom upstairs but if I had to wait, it was never long. Great tenants throughout my stay. Finally, Chad and Kellie were amazing! Super available, friendly and they have keeping  that place clean and organized to a science! They made my first few months in NY much easier! Very much recommended!"

Not only do they have a lovely house (tastefully decorated and lovingly maintained), but they've outfitted it with every necessity imaginable.  What's even more, should you have any particular needs or requests, they go over and above your expectations to help accommodate your particular situation. We couldn't be happier with our stay in Albany and they made it possible."
20519885,536880707,2019-09-27,294303365,Leigh Ann,"We rented the entire house for a week, for business a business trip. The home was immaculate, updated and exactly what we needed. The rooms were all very clean, beds were extremely comfortable,  bathrooms were spotless, and the kitchen was stocked with  everything one could possibly need.

All the beds were great (everyone loved theirs!) which was fantastic after long days at work. The kitchen was open and spacious which came in handy when we were all trying to make our own lunches each morning. It even has containers for leftovers or lunches! I believe each room had its own mini fridge, microwave and tv. We were able to fit two trucks in the parking (a third if we blocked the other two), but other than that, street parking was usually full. Whenever we’re in Albany for work, we will definitely stay here!!"

Plenty of space for everyone, TV's in each room loaded up with Netflix, Hulu etc. Great kitchen and dinning room table to make dinners if you are not looking to eat out. Dunkin Donuts and CVS 2 blocks away was nice if you need a quick coffee or drugstore run. Their home is stocked up with all you need for a comfortable stay. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking, spices, basic condiments and plenty of pots and pans. Lovely neighborhood too, would definitely recommend to a friend. Thanks Michael and Flerida!"

We appreciated the easy self check-in, sumptuous seating in the living room and on the adorable front porch and full size dining area! TV’s abound and the bathrooms are both beautifully finished. The bedrooms were very comfy and nicely decorated and each featured a/c with most having a TV and mini-fridge.

I'm fairly picky, so the little things go a long way for me. They had lots of hand sanitizer around the house, a good stock of soap, paper towel, etc. I stayed in the master bedroom with a king-size bed. It was very good, firm memory foam. Communication was easy and excellent. I was working with a small team in Albany and this place served as our base for three days. Definitely a good place to stay if you're in town."

I also really appreciated the variety of soaps and cleaning products they had available. <br/>Highly recommend and we would stay again next time we’re in Albany.

The hall, kitchen and dining space were a spacious and good place for everyone to get together. Televisions in every room, a computer, a very well equipped kitchen and board games further added to the charm of the house. The bathrooms were exceptionally well done. A great getaway for anyone in upstate New York!"
20519885,729211410,2021-02-06,120394206,Robert,"Michael and Flerida’s place were the perfect hosts. They were ready and more than willing to help with any issues we had, although there were none. Incredibly quick at responding, clean place, everything in the house worked great. Will definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in the area."

20519885,395632740473881123,2021-06-29,391397076,Wayne,Thank you Flerida and Michael for your personal care and attention to our every need.  We enjoyed our stay in your home and recommend it to all future travelers.
20519885,399868937344060984,2021-07-05,334599009,Janet,Great Airbnb! It was perfect for our family group. Very well maintained ! ❤️
20519885,406506888539190621,2021-07-14,85761932,Liz,"This is a very charming home, with some decent upgrades and thoughtful touches. The beds were comfortable, the entire place sparkling clean, and it was in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to Dunkin Donuts and Subway, and a short drive to so many other things. One thing to note is that floors in old homes creak. Our family is rather used to this, but for some others, getting up in the middle of the night is not a quiet affair and may take some getting used to. The stairways are also more narrow and steep, as is usual with older construction. The back stairway winds around more than many might be accustomed to, so be mindful of those who cannot navigate that easily. There is one small bedroom and full bath on the ground floor, which made the stairs a non-issue for the one in our party who couldn’t manage the stairs much. I cannot say enough great things about the hosts - they were very welcoming and easy to communicate with. We would stay there again next time we are in the area."
20519885,409381470283432695,2021-07-18,107400261,Brandi,"We were so happy we rented from Michael and Flerida. Not only were they warm and wonderful to communicate with, the house was perfect for our large family. Every room had smart tv’s and air conditioners (plus a dresser and desk!). The hand soaps, body washes, air fresheners, mass amount of linens, cleaning supplies, toilet paper, etc. was perfect. The rain shower was a favorite and the oversized tub was absolutely perfect for relaxing baths. I loved the one way street and the super quick walk to get coffee. I definitely recommend this house and Michael and Flerida as hosts!"
20519885,415181674532889971,2021-07-26,51963960,Amy,"The house is conveniently located in Albany NY. It has 5 bed rooms. Each of them has its own air conditioner, which handful meets everyone’s needs.<br/>Michael is a great owner. He worked an extra mile to ensure our stay as comfortable as we needs. He especially brought brand new soft/light weight comforters for our stay.<br/>We greatly appreciate Michael hosting us in each caring way! He made our trip in Albany memorable."
20519885,420919864463501456,2021-08-03,404332746,Maureen,"We (4 adults and 4 children) stayed in this house for a week, and had a great experience! It’s a charming home with lots of modern conveniences and has lots of room to spread out. Michael and Flerida, the hosts, were super helpful and very communicative. It is as advertised a “ 5 Star Immaculate Get Away”. We definitely look forward to staying here again."

It worked so well for our family, instead of staying in a hotel — so much room to just kick back and relax together comfortably, rather than in the open public space at a hotel."

This comfortable, clean and ideally located home suited  our family of five adults perfectly while we were in town for a wedding. It's a big old house that has been beautifully renovated. We were thrilled to each have our own room complete with ceiling fans, A/C and fluffy duvets, pillows and towels. From the spacious living/dining areas, fully equipped kitchen and inviting wicker-chaired veranda to the abundance of toiletries and board games,  private driveway and an exquisite stained glass window, Michael and Flerida haven't missed a beat. I also appreciated their immediate response to my questions.  Everything about it was easy and relaxing."

20519885,718121321633866842,2022-09-17,231126015,Allan,"We stayed at MIchael and Flerida's house for a family reunion of a group of 7 adults.  Our hosts were very gracious and responded quickly to some requests we had for some things for the house.  The house was very spacious for our group and the big dining room table was our main gathering place.  It is conveniently located to get to downtown Albany and grocery shopping etc. was close by.  Having said that the neighborhood is a little ""transitional"", although there is a very nice neighborhood just a couple of blocks away and also a nice park with a small lake.  The house is older and has character, but could use a thorough dusting. Overall the house worked well as for our group and as a home base for trips up and down the Hudson River Valley"
20519885,724645281265892673,2022-09-26,76141596,Paige,This is a great and comfortable house for a group!  We really enjoyed our stay.

20519885,769585128938355867,2022-11-27,52095802,Cindy,"Great stay!  The house was perfect for our family (6 adults, 1 teen) and with 5 bedrooms, everyone had their own space.   We were in town for Thanksgiving and Flerida and Michael made sure we  had everything we needed to prepare a big meal.  They were also super responsive to all my inquiries, from requesting early check-in to shifting dates of our stay to replacing the toaster at the house.  And the beds were super comfy.  With a Dunkin Donuts one block away and several of our favorite restaurants (The Fountain, Albany Oyster and Ale) within a mile, the location was great.  We hope to stay again next Thanksgiving."
20519885,790584723154915581,2022-12-26,2273431,Paul,"This is a classic, beautiful old home with plenty of space and all the amenities.

20519885,851402058709381418,2023-03-20,42325137,Deena,"We are a family of 8 adults and one toddler. It is hard to find places that can accommodate us that are affordable and have a flexible cancellation schedule. Michael & Flerida’s house ticked all the boxes. Location was right where we needed to be for the NCAA basketball tourney. Spacious first floor allowed us to be together comfortably. Bedrooms were nicely appointed (TVs in every bedroom for those late games). Kitchen had everything we needed. And the house itself was charming — arabesque arches, amazing original oak flooring, gorgeous woodwork and a stained glass window in the living room that just glowed in the sun! And clean!!! Michael & Flerida had great recommendations and were proactive in their contact with us. We have rented several houses in the past couple years, and this might be our favorite one. Neighborhood is a compact, urban residential one, but it was quiet, there was plenty of parking and we would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks so much for everything!"

We had two adults working remotely and didn't have any issues. We had everything we needed to stay a week. The hosts were very friendly and helpful. Michael had no issues with us checking in early and on short notice. He even came to turn on the air conditioning before we got there which was so appreciated. We would highly recommend staying here. Works great for families. There were ample towels, and other amenities. We had everything we needed."
20519885,957999663741204260,2023-08-14,508253478,Jenn,What a beautiful “ageless” home.  The original features of this gem shine. The hosts are quick and responsive to questions and extremely helpful.  <br/>This house is HUGE and beautifully kept. Updated but retains its original charms with stain glass window and original woodwork and features.  <br/>Each of the five bedrooms has its own ac and mini fridge with all the linens and pillows you could ask for. But the beds- I have not slept so comfortably away from home EVER!  <br/>The house has every necessity you could need but so much more. They really go the extra mile!  <br/>Was a perfect home away from home for my family! <br/>Centrally located in A super quiet and peaceful neighborhood- but also so close to everything you could need!  Easily walk to the corner for a fresh iced coffee or drive to the sights and restaurants!

It was spotlessly-clean, the kitchen was very well-supplied, and the laundry machines worked well.  There are two off-street parking spots.  The hosts were nice, and easy to reach by text.  We will definitely be back!"
20519885,1155893885659252900,2024-05-13,147549511,Donna,"Michael and Flerida’s house was  the perfect spot for our family to gather for our son’s graduation from UAlbany.  The house had plenty of room.  The kitchen had all the utensils we needed to prepare meals, while the dining room had ample room and seating for our family dinner celebration.  The house has some beautiful old wooden details, a front porch for relaxing and a quiet neighborhood with sidewalks for taking a walk . Michael and Flerida were always available throughout the process for any questions that  I may have had."
20519885,1175468374008363962,2024-06-09,59956727,Michael,"The hosts were friendly, polite and available when we needed to communicate with them. The house was clean and very comfortble, fitted out with plenty of the things needed for the bathroom. The kitchen had an ample supply of bottled water and sufficient cook- and eatware. Things like coffe and sugar are absent, so bring what you need in that regard. Three bedrooms sleep two each and two smaller ones sleep one each. They are spacious and comfortable with nice mattresses. The neighborhool was uninspiring, but the location is a mostly quiet street in an urban setting, and we spent pleasant evenings on the private and open front porch. Drive for food and entertainment, except there is a neighborhood bar one block down the street that fancies itself a fine restaurant with suitably fine pricing. But the food was good. We enjoyed our visit to Albany, and this house was a big part of it."

Very close to the major mall and big box stores in the area.  Many nearby establishments for food, wine, etc.  A short drive or bus ride to mid town and downtown Albany. <br/>We were surprised at the quality of the beds and linens , towels, etc., that were what we have experienced in 5 star hotels.  The home features abundant, comfortable seating, large wall mounted TVs in every room.  Cable and Netflix, Hulu, etc., provided.  That appliances are new and top end  including the washer and dryer.  Plenty of gas fired hot water.  It never got cool or warm ;always hot.  And the best is Peter who lives nearby and  nearly immediately responded to the few questions we had and was very attentive without being intrusive.  This is the perfect place to stay if visiting SUNY, the State Office Campus or nearby colleges and attractions in the Albany area."

There's a TV with like all of the entertainment outlets (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBOGo, etc) and a ton of living room seating. There's a little bit of a yard and a rocking chair in the back. The street is nice and quiet, with all kinds of birds and squirrels and really pretty yards that were full of flowers when we were there-- it's a lovely neighborhood for short little walks. There's a little strip mall within walking distance with a Rite Aid and some sandwich/pizza places and a wine shop. We were there to take the bar and really appreciated the comfort, quiet, and generally stress free atmosphere that Piotr created! I would definitely stay here again if I ever come back to Albany. "

And the place itself is great in every way... from the location, the supplies (cooking essentials, towels, body wash, extra sheets) all down to the decor which is even cuter than we expected!! Overall it was an awesome stay. Downtown, bars, and restaurants are only about 10-15 mins away and everything you could need is just around the corner(drugstore, grocery store, gas stations, liquor, etc) I would 1000% stay again and recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy spot in a quiet cute neighborhood!

There is ample seating in the living room. We loved having TVs in each bedroom as well.

It is also an easy walk to the New York State Museum and Capitol building. James also is easy to communicate with and gets back to you right away. I recommend staying here.
20633175,405682695,2019-01-27,74218437,Michelle,Loved the food it was all organic and yummy. The apartment is cute and super clean.My boyfriend enjoyed the local beer. This place is very drafty because of it being a basement apartment with plenty of windows and a door outside next to the bed. The heat although we put it higher for it being 18 degrees out it did not stay on the whole night and was set weirdly to not stay on the level that was set. Got cold at night and had to wear a hoodie with several blankets even by the couch. This place is perfect for the spring or warmer months. I would love to see the outdoor garden when it’s not full of snow. James is very nice and helpful.

20633175,412840338,2019-02-16,126640174,Beth,"James really goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome.  On Valentine's Day we were greeted with flowers, chocolate, and wine.  The fruit, bagels, and juice in the fridge meant we didn't have to go out in the cold to search for breakfast.  Everything was super clean.  The memory foam mattress was very comfortable.  James responded quickly to any communication.  The location is great if you're attending an event at The Egg.  We walked to The Egg and the NY State Museum in just minutes.  We would definitely stay with James again."

20633175,474961705,2019-06-23,261047242,Edwin,"I’m so glad we booked our yearly Albany stay with James. I went with my son and it was a great family weekend.  Everything in the apartment was clean, organized and very well curated. James is very generous and has a stocked kitchen to be able to make quick meals if need be, traveling with a kid means quick breakfast and coffee for Mom. There were muffins, jam, butter and eggs available to whip up.  <br/>It’s also really close to everything near Lark Street and parks. We’re definitely going to be back in the fall with the rest of the bunch. Thank you so much James!"

20633175,497531742,2019-07-28,40063289,Adam,James' place was cozy and amazing. James himself is awesome as is his little slice of Albany. I will be returning... and I would suggest anyone who wants to visit Albany to check out James' listing first.
20633175,500118288,2019-08-01,177526288,Craig,"This place was perfect! I stayed here while taking the bar exam in Albany, and it was a quiet, comfortable apartment, just a short walk from the capital center. Great place to stay, and James is super helpful and responsive."

Definitely stay here on your next trip to Albany, we had an amazing time. Our stay included several amenities including breakfast, fresh flowers and orange juice, full kitchen, dog treats (he knew we were bringing our dog), and bathroom extras. We enjoyed our stay and plan to stay here again on our next visit"
20633175,563017301,2019-11-11,157966204,Sabrina,"I highly suggest Jame's place for everyone coming to Albany. It is a short walk to Empire Plaza and Downtown, literally around 10 minutes. It is located right across Lincoln Park as well, which adds a lot to the location. In addition, the place is unbelievably clean and it feels very homey, since James added a lot of touches to make it feel more comfortable for guests. He also included a binder full of information about things to do in Albany, nearby cafes, nearby restaurants, and all the information any guest may want to know about the area. The hospitality was ridiculous! James lives nearby and was very easy to reach. Also, he provided breakfast of New York style bagels, fresh milk, and juice. If I were to visit Albany again, I would 100% stay at James' a second time!"
20633175,566787818,2019-11-20,23966291,Laura,James is a mist gracios host!

20633175,603709330,2020-02-09,96563235,Mikko,"James was the consummate host. In addition to the organic sheets and eco-friendly soaps and cleansers, he provided a spotless and homey space that allowed for my aunt and myself to feel cared for and special. James is at the ready with answers to questions and his responses are practically immediate. We stayed during a snowstorm and the space was always warm and the sleeping was easy. I stayed on the futon and it was roomy. If you come in winter, bring slippers since the floor can get a little chilly, which I bet makes for a lovely treat in the summer."
20633175,606691376,2020-02-16,203622503,Brandon,This place was great. Perfect size for my wife and I to get away and bring our pups. We went to a show at times union center which is only a 5 minute uber ride away. Great park right across the street for the dogs. Tons Of places to eat and drinks all around. Will definitely stay here again.

Full luxurious bathroom with organic products and towels provided.  Well equipped kitchen with full appliances as well as microwave and Keurig coffee maker. Cabinet is stocked with basic condiments. In short, owner has thought of everything to make a comfortable, well appointed place to stay. As promised, patter of small feet can very occasionally be heard overhead but it's not at all unreasonable or objectionable.  Market is just around the corner. Restaurants are in easy walking distance.<br/>If you're there for concerts at the Egg, it's really too far to walk at night but it is only a 6 minute drive away.  We give it our highest recommendation."
20633175,633579922,2020-06-30,19373437,Ivan,very responsive and accommodating host.

20633175,714744194,2020-12-11,348742047,Amanda,"We stayed a little over 1 week & are thoroughly satisfied. We travel with a service dog & encountered zero issues. The space is clean, spacious, well laid out & conveniently located. We were pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful touches of a well stocked kitchen of utensils, cooking items & herbs/spices along with KCups & tea! All the cleaning products (which are environmentally & allergen conscious) are easily accessible for us to clean behind ourselves. 10/10 will be staying here again if available!"
20633175,718364496,2020-12-26,346605072,Fabio,The place is very nice and well decorated and the pictures don't do justice to the coziness and actual space of the apartment. James was also very diligent in answering questions.

20633175,756743446,2021-05-09,96662497,Jonathan,"All was well until I walked to my car to retrieve some water with an unlit cigar in my mouth. After seeing me in the window, James rang our doorbell and felt as if he needed to remind us that this was a ""no smoking"" premises. When there was clearly no smell nor smoking, he would peer through our window whenever walking up the stairs. We had to close the blinds. James later requested we pay a $50 for cleaning fee because of a strong ""cologne"" smell. When I called Airbnb to dispute the charge, the agent agreed that this was a preposterous claim. I realized that James's issues with us stemmed from something a little deeper than what was on the surface. Brothers beware!!! You know that ""feeling"" when you encounter it."
20633175,759114396,2021-05-16,110671515,Shelby,Easy check in process and did the job as needed for a place to sleep
20633175,389075266183757827,2021-06-20,5771853,Joel,"This is a ground-floor apartment that feels spacious, with a well-stocked kitchen and comfortable bathroom. James is a gracious, attentive host: he responded quickly to any and all issues, then fixed it asap. The place is centrally located and easy walking distance to the Lark St. strip of restaurants, bars, and coffeehouses. We enjoyed our stay."
20633175,394143764882716448,2021-06-27,47387211,Brian,So close to so many great places to eat. We were able to easily walk and grab a great bulgogi sub from son of egg the day we got in and then right across the street got a great bowl of poutine and burgers at Savoy Taproom. There was always parking at the house so never had to worry about taking the car out and coming back.

There is a huge construction project underway a few hundred feet away, but they start and finish at reasonable times, so no problem.  Great value for the price.  I’ll be back."
20633175,415109706914149897,2021-07-26,15195699,Jeff,"Apartment was great.   Everything worked and was clean and up to date.  The capitol plaza is just a 10 minute walk and there are lots of little restaurants and a grocery a couple of blocks away. The space was a bit humid during July when I was there even with the dehumidifier working 24/7, but I'm sure the former basement wasn't optimized for ventilation when it was built in the 19th century.  The neighborhood is a bit sketchy to look at, but I never felt in danger and I walked everywhere day and night noodling around with Pokemon Go while I was there.  This is a fine choice."
20633175,418805780306265064,2021-07-31,65133158,Phil,Good location. Had everything we needed. James is very welcoming and helpful.

20633175,681103057504841200,2022-07-28,429779385,Anais,"Very quiet, comfortable and well equipped place. Close to everything in the city. I recommend!"
20633175,694168151536797655,2022-08-15,64459454,Jeremy,A nice little apartment near a quite hip part of Albany.
20633175,697086358031066492,2022-08-19,23385346,Deborah J,A great place to stay when visiting Albany.  We really appreciate James letting us park on the street using his guest pass.  The apartment was very safe.  You enter through the front door and then you have another door on your right to enter into the apartment.  Both doors have locks.  The shower worked great.  We enjoyed the Keurig coffee machine every morning.
20633175,703629301727857737,2022-08-28,95192375,Danielle,Very clean and updated AirBnb apartment. It was equipped with everything you would need for a long or short stay. A good bed and nice bathroom. James was a great host and there when you needed him (to help me check in). Communication with James was easy and and the place looked exactly like it does in the pictures on the AirBnB sight. Would recommend staying there!
20633175,709423668531578086,2022-09-05,28311984,Laura,Great apartment! Close to all the local attractions & highway. Super clean & quiet location. Very easy access to parks for our furry friend! Would stay again if in the area. Thanks James!
20633175,711625357791021050,2022-09-08,154347022,Stephen,Very affordable and great Airbnb! James was super helpful with checking in and also went above and beyond replacing the Keurig in the unit before my stay. Great location and very walkable area in Albany.
20633175,713726948195259403,2022-09-11,34229043,Heather And Mark,"Nice place, as described. Close to some good restaurants. James responded quickly. I’d stay there again."
20633175,717429527091476273,2022-09-16,110648825,Chaitanya,Great house and good location. James was very helpful. I really suggest James place for the stay.
20633175,723943200155845705,2022-09-25,205769129,Justin,"This is a well-maintained and clean unit, and the owner has put a lot of thought into furnishing and stocking a nice kitchen. Perfect location for walking to downtown Albany (e.g. State Museum - probably not MVP Arena) and also up to Washington Park area. Quite near Lark Street but quiet area. No parking issues, and owner put me on guest pass. Although a garden apartment, it felt secure with a two door entry system. The owner was very good at communication.<br/>Notes: Those with mobility concerns may want to avoid, since there is a small step down from the bedroom to the kitchenette. There is a dehumidifier in the unit that needs to run at all times - it didn't bother me, and actually offers a little white noise, but if it bothers you, you can slide bedroom door shut. Finally, I set the smoke alarm off taking a shower- owner advises closing door to bathroom to avoid this."
20633175,726034440453814533,2022-09-28,154705621,Anthony,"Really nice place, great value for money,  very hospitable"

20633175,737720655660323373,2022-10-14,192349403,Emily,We had a wonderful stay!
20633175,740513751696346864,2022-10-18,185882359,Melynda,The apartment is a basement apartment in part of Albany that is in the midst of rejuvenation.  While the AirBNB is fine - our stay left a bad taste in our mouth.<br/>There is no access to laundry and when we asked the host for a second towel he let us know he expected us to use the same towel for four days.  After we left - the host sent a bill to us claiming extra laundering expenses ($15) for leaving the two towels in an open shopping bag.  He let us know that he was having someone watching us and upset that we had our 20 year old son stay with us Saturday night.  The host claimed we broke a glass and charged us $5.00 which we refused to pay (we didn't brake the glass).
20633175,744947306468666046,2022-10-24,94425908,Nancy,Cute apartment!  James was great-easy to communicate with and was very accommodating for my daughter and I. Appreciate the parking permit and assistance with parking. Nice and quiet.
20633175,749241848242883360,2022-10-30,240111950,Monica,"James' garden apartment was cozy, warm, inviting.  Wonderful bed for a great night's sleep.  It's all and more than it's advertised on Airbnb.  :)"

The bed was extremely comfortable and James was very accommodating and available to help if needed. I would definitely stay here again if visiting the area!
20633175,1155135161330504288,2024-05-12,12984298,Chris,"We had a great few days staying at James’s apartment, although as we were there for our nephew’s graduation we mainly used the apartment for sleeping. The park across the street made for a peaceful quiet street, and we loved the old brick of the street. Parking was simple as we arrived after the 2hr parking  ended for the weekend, and James’s instructions for getting in were simple. <br/>The place was super clean and uncluttered.  We lived how close it was to Lark Street for dinner.  I did have a little trouble with the back neighbors talking outside until the wee hours of the morning, but moved the air purifier to the bedroom for white noise the second night and slept super well after that! <br/>Wish we had more time to explore but enjoyed the Savoy Taproom on Lark St and Betty Boop diner a bit farther away!"
20671966,192903405,2017-09-11,9729824,Elliott,Great spot if you're in Albany!

20671966,269042261,2018-05-26,46225265,Maura,"Bella was as delightful to deal with as the place itself. Spotlessly clean, comfy and the off street parking was the charm. Would recommend and am looking forward to staying again."

20671966,579831573,2019-12-21,289520903,Kaitlynn,I really enjoyed my stay again. I needed to stay a bit later while I was waiting to take a state licensure exam and finish up school and I am extremely grateful that Bela was accommodating. A very stressful time for me was made much more bearable my last day. I highly recommend staying here.

20671966,716519499,2020-12-19,58923790,Riley,"The house has a bed and breakfast vibe. The top floor is completely private however you do enter through common space. The top floor is very spacious with multiple rooms and all of the needed furniture. Wifi is shared with other house guests and in the time of virtual meetings was spotty for zoom calls. The location is very close to the hospital, the schools (law, pharmacy, and Russell sage) and some restaurants. Overall a very walkable area and felt very safe."

The location is great and in a quieter neighborhood so walking to or from events always felt safe. The apartment itself is a step into the past (with all the included amenities of today) and may inspire the creative thinker.

21052414,342397010,2018-10-28,7847036,Emanuel,"Die Unterkunft von Chad ist hervorragend. Das Zimmer neu hergerichtet, Küche, Bad und Gemeinschaftsraum super. Möglichkeit zu waschen ist vorhanden. Die Lage ist in einem ruhigen Wohnviertel, aber ausgezeichnet um schnell in die Stadt zu kommen. Chad selbst ist ein super Host, und hat alles ausführlich beschrieben. Habe mich aus Versehen einmal ausgesperrt und Chad war schnell da um zu helfen. Werde sofort wieder hierher kommen, wenn ich nach Albany zurückkehre."
21052414,408508043,2019-02-04,98039892,Samantha,"Chad and Kelly are amazing hosts! The are very friendly and easy to communicate with. They respond right away to any needs at the house.

Keep up the good work."
21052414,418189024,2019-03-01,95568859,Apurv,Nice place!
21052414,454548035,2019-05-18,146731975,Lucy,I would say Chad and Kellie are the best hosts who you can find in Albany. When there is a problem they response back in short time and solve it right away. They are super sweet and I could tell they are always trying hard to make their guest stays comfortable and happy. When I come back to Albany I  will definitely like to book again :)
21052414,457696552,2019-05-24,15652249,Michael,"Pluses: superbly clean, close to UAlbany Downtown, large upstairs bedroom with generous closet space, hangars & shelves, water bottles & toiletries, great wifi, decorating, morning sunlight, and washer/dryer in the basement. Bedroom furniture consists of the bed, and a small table under the wall-mounted TV.  Shared kitchen setup is terrific.<br/>Note this is one of several guest bedrooms (2 on second floor, 1 on ground floor) that all share one bathroom, which is on the ground floor. You might have some wait at rush hours. You might hear other guests talking in the next bedroom, separated by thin walls.  The home is not host-occupied.  <br/>The room smelled ""off"" when closed up with AC running for any period of time. Chad and Kellie were quick to respond, and communicated well about the situation, which was new for my stay.  They are definitely super-hosts."
21052414,461996667,2019-06-01,245419973,Emily,"This was a very nice house. Everything is clearly/cutely labeled and when the hosts are there they leave little notes by the door so you don’t freak out lol. It is communal, with 2 bedrooms on the top floor and one on the bottom, from what I could see, but each room has a lock. The bathroom+kitchen were shared. The kitchen was super well stocked with everything you could need to make a meal - pots, pans, knives etc. I really appreciated that. Bathroom has a nice body mirror and the mirror above the sink, is was very large and well stocked. Enjoyed that you could do laundry. Overall this was a great place to spend time and I would stay there again."
21052414,495808274,2019-07-26,49203316,Dame,Nice clean place to stay! Bathroom downstairs from bedroom as described if you don't mind going back and fourth. Great Amenities!

21052414,645259769,2020-08-01,48524337,Kenneth,"Chad & Kellie are fantastic hosts. Some of the best hospitality I’ve experienced at an Airbnb.<br/>From our initial communication, they have been quick to respond to and accommodated me, address any concerns/questions, and just chat about local recommendations. I felt at home and comfortable the entire time.<br/>Their home is perfectly situated close to Washington Park if you want to spend time outside and plenty of restaurants.<br/>Will definitely stay with them again when I visit Albany."
21052414,664660055,2020-09-15,360533394,Jonathan,A nice little place not too far from a main road with a lot of shops and such. I enjoyed my stay and the hosts were very gracious and helpful. I would love to come again for a get away instead of the circumstances the hosts helped us with.
21052414,667818403,2020-09-25,205579038,Amy,"I stayed in the upstairs room with 2 walk-in closets. The staircase is narrow. House is furnished with everything needed, even washer and dryer. There is only one bathroom for 3 rooms. Chad and Kellie are great hosts, they always replied quickly."

The room was spacious and neat, had (plenty!) of closet space, and was air conditioned (lifesaver!). I had two great housemates who I became friends with, which made it even more comfortable. The shared spaces are clean and easy to navigate. I loved that everything was labelled and easy to understand. The laundry room has both washer and dryer, there is an iron, and a nice kitchen which is well stocked with table and cookware. <br/>Lastly, the hosts- Chad was so helpful and responsive, he was an incredibly helpful and friendly host. I would totally reccomend this place!"

21392315,240384209,2018-03-04,17814177,Bob,"This is a nice space in a very convenient area near Sage College of Albany. It has three rooms, including the bathroom.  The sleeper sofa is in the same room as the kitchen and, of course, there is a bedroom.  It is well furnished.  The furniture is mostly very used but tastefully arranged.  It is setup so that a moderately intelligent person can check themselves in and out.  <br/>Also, there is off street parking behind the house. There is an entrance back there but you will have to come to the front entrance to get your keys. Moreover, the back entrance takes your through the unfinished part of the basement, which was neat and tidy.<br/>This was just better than I expected for the price."
21392315,251862481,2018-04-08,176094308,Roxanne,"I felt that I was home. Even some coffee and tea was available.

The location is far from downtown if you are walking, but this isn't a problem at all if you are willing to take the bus from the nearby bustops. It is also very close to Washington Park, which made for beautiful evening jogging. I would definitely recommend to anyone, and would gladly stay again."

21392315,356231759,2018-12-07,134932637,Mary,This is a cute apartment on a nice street in downtown Albany. We found restaurants within walking distance. We come to Albany on business and have stayed in hotels on the commercial strip. This gave us the opportunity to explore downtown Albany. Loved staying here.
21392315,409743204,2019-02-08,172413531,Elizabeth,"I stayed in the Blair suite for 6 weeks and it had everything I needed to make it my temporary home during that time! It is a very private and quiet apartment and I loved the off-street parking which is difficult to find in Albany. The apartment is located on the basement level of the home, but you also have access to the shared spaces upstairs which I enjoyed exploring as the house is an absolutely beautiful traditional colonial. Bela was available for any questions I had (and quickly arrived to help me when I locked myself out one day!!). The location of the home is perfect as it is central to everything (short drive to groceries, quick walk to the park, Starbucks, restaurants, etc.). I would recommend the Blair suite for short- or long-term stays!"
21392315,410718820,2019-02-10,33070229,Kim,Bela was quick to respond to my questions and her place was clean and comfortable. We had a great time!

21392315,539058523,2019-09-30,100160097,Cynthia,"Bela and Laurie were great hosts! Their place was spacious, clean and conveniently located. If you’re above average size the full-sized bed and tiny shower may be a problem, but other than that, it was exactly what we needed!"
21392315,540456106,2019-10-03,296552050,Mary,A lovely inn that is private and quiet.  The common area is nice but you have all you need in the Blair Suite.

I'm not sure if there was a pan, I ate lots of take out and used my own utensils because I travel that much.<br/>It felt as if I were visiting my grandparents. The wood paneling isn't stylish, but it's truly homey.<br/>I would stay here again."
21392315,552824420,2019-10-22,256534316,Yolanda,"The Inn is very private, and cozy in a very nice quiet neighborhood.  There is ample parking in the back of the house.
